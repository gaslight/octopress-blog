  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&#8217;s the correct regular expression to use for matching text within quotes of a Cucumber step? I argue that It&#8217;s not the one suggested by Cucumber itself.</p>

<p>If I run a step missing step:</p>

<pre><code>When I click "Edit"
</code></pre>

<p>Cucumber will suggest:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">When /^I click "(.*?)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
</code></pre>

<p>The practice for most is to copy that suggestion into their step definition file, and implement the step.</p>

<p>Often I&#8217;ve run into trouble when I&#8217;ve needed to create a slightly more specific version of that step in a succeeding test:</p>

<pre><code>When I click "Edit" for "Jack"
</code></pre>

<p>Running the step, I&#8217;ll get:</p>

<pre><code>no link or button 'Edit" for "Jack' found (Capybara::ElementNotFound) 
</code></pre>

<p>The regex defined in our initial step is a valid match for this step, unintentionally. The regex matches everything between a quote character, and the last quote character in the string. In this case &#8216;Edit&#8221; for &#8220;Jack&#8217;.</p>

<p>As proof, attempting to implement the new step using Cucumber&#8217;s recommended format yields:</p>

<pre><code>Ambiguous match of "I click "Edit" for "Jack"":
  features/step_definitions/running_stuff_steps.rb:12:in `/^I click "(.*?)"$/'
  features/step_definitions/running_stuff_steps.rb:16:in `/^I click "(.*?)" for "(.*?)"$/'
</code></pre>

<p>Both regexes are valid matches for that step.</p>

<p>So we need a regular expression to uniquely match each step. The problem regex says &#8220;match everything between the first and last quote characters&#8221;. We need it to say &#8220;match text between a quote and the next quote, regardless of where the end of the line is&#8221;. Or, in regular expression language, not this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">/^I click "(.*?)"$/
</code></pre>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">/^I click "([^"]*)"$/
</code></pre>

<p>This isn&#8217;t rocket science, but I&#8217;ve witnessed a few smart people scratching their heads on this one, not wanting to spend the mental energy to switch from whatever feature they are working on to dissect regular expressions.</p>

<p>Is there any good reason to default to the former over the latter? Is a pull request warranted?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Game Over!</strong></p>

<p>Since the last update I have been on and returned from vacation only to discover that our friends at FreshBooks have reversed course on their stated (to us) intention to not implement Stripe integration. On or about August 24 they released a feature permitting their users to enter their Stripe key to begin accepting payments for FreshBooks invoices via Stripe. This is of course entirely their prerogative. Unfortunately for us their prerogative removes every single one of PaidSimply&#8217;s value propositions.</p>

<p>Of course we had envisioned the possibility, and in fact the eventuality of FreshBook&#8217;s implementing this feature. Had we been doing well enough for ourselves all we may have accomplished is validating FreshBook&#8217;s need to add Stripe integration. We&#8217;d be no less dead at that point albeit with a few bucks in our pocket. So perhaps FreshBooks has done us a favor. We&#8217;ve barely touched the project&#8217;s budget.</p>

<p><strong>Or is it?</strong></p>

<p>So is this really game over? We don&#8217;t know. Perhaps PaidSimply may pivot into a FreshBooks competitor, seeking to re-segment the existing Web-based invoicing market as a simple, low-cost alternative. This seems the most likely course of action if sufficient stomach remains within the organization to move that solution forward.</p>

<p>I regret that this experiment was so short-lived. I hope that it won&#8217;t be the last. If so for PaidSimply then I&#8217;m fairly certain the next product to spring out of Gaslight will be similarly documented and blogged about. Have any ideas as how best to proceed from here? I&#8217;d love to read about them in the comments below.</p>

<p>Thanks and so long for now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I decided to check out <a href="http://lessmoney.lesseverything.com/">LessMoneyConf</a> and see what other companies similar to mine were doing, and if they experience the same types of challenges we do.  It was certainly interesting to hear how others were solving similar problems, but it wasn’t until the last hour of the last day that I heard someone say something, however obscure, that stuck in my mind ever since.</p>
<p><span>There was a particular discussion about how to solve a difficult business issue that would be hard to solve and still keep everyone happy.  Without spending a lot of time describing the problem, the comment was made that in the end, you should do what makes you happy.  “Do what makes you happy?”  At first I thought, “Really? Is this guy saying I should only be concerned with my own personal happiness without regard to anyone else?” That certainly didn&#8217;t make sense to me, however, on further reflection, I realize now that’s not what he meant at all.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why should I care about happiness?</strong></p>
<p><span>I doubt anyone would disagree that our lives are very busy.  Most families have two income earners, kids are in school 8 hours a day, sports, homework, etc.  My life isn’t much different, although with the added responsibility of running a business.  Decisions are hard.  Trying to balance work and family is hard. Trying not to feel too stressed is hard.  All of these things have been bouncing around in the back of my mind, then I heard this seemingly content individual say, “Do what makes you happy.”  Why should I care about happiness when it comes to business, I mean, does happiness really matter?</span></p>
<p><span>Happiness is about our lives as a whole.  It’s a description of our overall satisfaction with life.  It’s certainly influenced by our genetics, upbringing, and experiences, but that’s only half of the story.  Research shows that about 50% of our own happiness is influenced by our genetics and upbringing.  That being true, what about the other 50%?  Many people mistakenly believe, including myself, that income and environment to be the greatest contributor to overall happiness.  Makes sense right?  If I have enough money to feel secure, I’ll be happier.  If my environment is less stressful, I’ll be happier.  The same research shows this isn’t the case; in fact, income and environment only contribute about 10% to our overall happiness.  So, what about the other 40%? I’m learning the other 40% gets to the core of what this guy was saying, “Do what makes you happy.”</span></p>
<p><strong>All things considered, how happy are you?</strong></p>
<p><span>There have been significant advances in the science of well being in recent years.  This research has led many to try and measure happiness and the factors that affect it.  It’s interesting to note that the most basic way of measuring personal happiness is to ask a very basic question, “How do you feel about your life?” or “All things considered, how happy are you?”  Certainly the answers to these questions are subjective in nature, but the answers in reality are correlated to objective brain activity.  There are many more studies that show happiness is responsible for better body function, especially immune response.  People that are more generally positive are less likely to get the flu. In fact, positive meditation training has been shown to actually increase the density of grey-matter around the hippocampus, known to be important for learning and memory function, also in brain structures associated with compassion and introspection.</span></p>
<p><span>“Do what makes you happy” is at the core of the 40%.  It doesn’t mean do whatever to fulfill your own selfish desires; on the contrary, the other 40% contributes to our overall happiness by the activities, relationships, and overall outlook we have in our lives.  The conscious choices we make each day really matter.  How we treat one another matters.  How we treat our customers and our employees matter.  The relationships we build matter.  This is the point that was being made by this smart guy.  Make decisions each day that influence your own personal happiness, which can’t be done at the expense of others, but rather with others.  People who care more about others are always happier than those who care less about others.  He is saying, care more about your customers, care more about your employees, your employees families, your own family.  It all matters!</span></p>
<p><strong>Happiness breeds success.</strong></p>
<p><span>Most people mistakenly think that success breed’s happiness.  I’ve thought the very same thing for many years, but this formula is backwards.  Happiness breeds success.  It’s scientific.  People who experience positive emotions in a 3-to-1 ratio to negative emotions reach a tipping point in their lives and become more naturally resilient to adversity and are better equipped to achieve the things important in their lives.  The good news is, we all can choose to live our lives happier, no matter our circumstances.  When we make this choice, we influence each one around us.  So, in business, work, or any aspect of our lives, the decisions we make should absolutely be weighted by how happy it makes us.  “Do what makes you happy.”  I get it now… Happiness matters.</span></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d been meaning to actually build something worthwhile with iOS since I
first heard about the SDK. A few months ago, we started work on a client
project that was going to start out life as a mobile web application and
evolve in to a native app. <a href="https://twitter.com/pkananen">Peter</a> was interested in the project and often
said that we would be able to deliver faster by just giving up and going
native. Since the app used quite a bit of GPS functionality, we decided to
give it a day and spike something out.</p>

<p>As a Rubyist, I&#8217;m a bit spoiled. A couple years ago, <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda">Carlhuda</a> began
working on a project that had a bit of a rough start but quickly became a
standard link in my toolchain. Of course I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://gembundler.com">Bundler</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d heard about <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a> and had experimented with iOS before, but never
taken the time to set things up and give it a try. On this spike, we gave it a
shot. There was a bit of fumbling at first, mostly because of my own ignorance
of linker flags and header search paths. Once we were set up, we were off and
running.</p>

<p>Our experience with CocoaPods has been pretty great. It takes care of much of
the &#8220;busy work&#8221; involved in using external libraries in your Xcode
applications. Recently, though, I&#8217;ve heard some iOS developers berate
CocoaPods, so I thought I&#8217;d take a few minutes and explain just how much
you&#8217;re getting for free when you &#8220;give up and use pods&#8221;.</p>

<h2>The Old Way</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll use the quick and easy setup from <a href="https://twitter.com/samsoffes">Sam Soffes</a>&#8217; <a href="http://sstoolk.it">SSToolkit</a> page as a
reference. You can see that it isn&#8217;t trivial. Or quick. Or easy.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdmwebs.com/s/SSToolkit-20120822-231013.jpg" alt="sstoolkit_img"/></p>

<p>Nine steps. Nine! Before you get to do any of the fun stuff! Plus, now you&#8217;ve
downloaded old code. Want to update? Download the new zip, extract it, add the right
files (did they change? are there new files?), click Build and wait patiently
for the spinning wheel of death. Maybe not quite that drastic, but still more 
work than I&#8217;d like to do.</p>

<h4>Wait, wait! You can use&#8230;</h4>

<p>Yeah, I know. I can eliminate the download of the zip/tarball step with everyone&#8217;s
favorite: <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html">git submodules</a>!</p>

<p>I kid. Submodules have come a long way, too. They&#8217;re actually really awesome these 
days, but I <strong>still</strong> have to do all the stuff after I get the library on my
filesystem.</p>

<h2>The Better Way</h2>

<p>Now let&#8217;s do the same thing with CocoaPods. Keep in mind, though, that the
setup is a one-time cost. Once you&#8217;ve got a Podfile, adding a new library is
as easy as adding a new line and running <code>pod install</code>. If you&#8217;re the
screencast watching type, go no further than <a href="http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/5-cocoapods">NSScreencast</a> and watch right
now. That one&#8217;s free, but they&#8217;re well worth the subscription fee.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, install CocoaPods. If you&#8217;ve never messed with your Ruby
installation, it&#8217;s as easy as <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>. Shouldn&#8217;t take
too long.</li>
<li>Just this first time, run <code>pod setup</code> and CocoaPods will clone the spec
repo to a folder in your $HOME folder. Podspecs are the files CocoaPods
uses to learn how to find, install and configure libraries.</li>
<li><p>Next, create and edit a Podfile. It&#8217;s case sensitive, so make sure to call
it that. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll put in there:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">  platform :ios
  xcodeproj 'MyProject.xcodeproj'

  pod 'SSToolkit'
</code></pre></li>
<li>That&#8217;s it. Run <code>pod install</code> and watch the magic. The first time you
install, CocoaPods will create a new Workspace that sets up your project
and the CocoaPods project properly. <strong>Make sure you open the Workspace file
going forward!</strong></li>
<li>Ready to update the code? As of now, you&#8217;ll have to delete the library you
want to update in the Pods folder and run <code>pod install</code> again. It <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/447">looks
like</a> we&#8217;re getting some <code>update</code> and <code>outdated</code> subcommands soon, 
though!</li>
</ol><p>Here&#8217;s what CocoaPods just did for you:</p>

<ul><li>Cloned the repo (or downloaded the zip archive) of SSToolkit.</li>
<li>Linked the Pods project to your existing app&#8217;s target.</li>
<li>Added the necessary files or directories to the Header Search Paths.</li>
<li>Using ARC and the library isn&#8217;t? That&#8217;s handled, too. -fno-objc-arc is set
on all the included library&#8217;s files!</li>
<li><strong>BONUS</strong>: If you&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>, it&#8217;s <strong>generated documentation
from the library</strong> and it&#8217;s ready for you to search and use in Organizer!</li>
</ul><p>That&#8217;s quite a bit of awesome. Now go write all the code! If you&#8217;d like to
read a bit more, check out this post on <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/12139/introduction-to-cocoapods">Ray Wenderlich</a>, too.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s an animated gif of a certain sporting event that I saw on a certain broadcasting network&#8217;s website tonight. I expect a cease and desist any minute now, so let&#8217;s hurry.</p>

<p><br/><a href="http://twitpic.com/ah4i7m" title="hey guys, I made an animated gif!"><img src="http://twitpic.com/show/thumb/ah4i7m.gif" alt="hey guys, I made an animated gif!"/></a>
<br/><br/></p>

<p>I made that (President Obama), but I don&#8217;t know if I would do it again, unless it was easier. So what&#8217;s the best way to create an animated gif with mostly free tools, or highly-recommeded cheap tools, on OS X?</p>

<p>I can let you know how I did it, but I can promise you it&#8217;s horrible.</p>

<ol><li style="margin-bottom: 1em">I used Quicktime Player&#8217;s File -&gt; &#8220;New Screen Recording&#8221; to record the clip, playing on the site. Win.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">I trimmed the clip in Quicktime, and attempted to upload it to several GIF-making websites. Failure all.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">I opened the clip full screen. I mashed the right arrow key four times and then took a screenshot, and repeated until the scrubber hit the end of the clip. 58 times. Work harder, not smarter.</li>

<div style="float:right; text-align:center">
<img style="margin-top:-10px" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8h0b5pPnz1r9fv8b.png"/><br/><img style="margin-top:-10px" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gzzk6Qef1r9fv8b.png"/></div>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">I needed to compile these into a .gif image. Pixelmator couldn&#8217;t do it, Preview could not hang either, Pixen kept crashing. I landed on, of all things, <a href="http://www.stone.com/GIFfun/">GIFfun</a>. Congratulations GIFfun, you have been selected!</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">I created a workflow in OS X Automator to scale the 58 images down 33%, because screenshot-ing them all at full screen resolution (see Step 3) was a terrible idea. I don&#8217;t hear many people talk about Automator. If you need to automate stuff, Automator is the best.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">GIFfun took a little finagling at first. It&#8217;s either a little wonky, or not 100% idiot proof. There was a window that I closed, and couldn&#8217;t get back without re-opening the app. But anyway, &#8220;Load Folder&#8230;&#8221; turns out to be what I wanted. It chronologized the images in a timeline with a default delay value, and when I clicked &#8220;Make Gif&#8221;, it was damn near instanatious. I have to hand it to GIFfun on that.</li>
</ol><p>So that&#8217;s my long story. I forgot to mention that I managed to record the Quicktime Player controls in every screenshot, which is lame. I don&#8217;t see a way around that, except to not do it that way.</p>

<p>So what is the best way?</p>

<p>Our goals from <a href="http://blog.gaslightsoftware.com/2012/07/27/paidsimply-lean-canvas.html">last week’s update</a> were to ensure Google Analytics were running on the landing page and get approval of the tentative budget including an additional AdWords campaign. We’re not committed to spending anything yet, except the initial AdWords campaign to drive traffic to the <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">landing page</a>. Unlike purely entrepreneurial endeavors, we’ll have to secure buy-in from the team or face shutting the project down. Not exactly aggressive but all these goals were accomplished.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Fresh on the heals of <a href="http://cincinnati.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Cincinnati</a> it seemed narrow-sighted to be building <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">PaidSimply</a>, even for internal use, without some external validation of interest in our solution. So we’ve published a <a href="http://bit.ly/Mam6uZ">market research survey</a> and are seeking input.</p>

<p>We’ve launched the <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">landing page</a> despite the fact that we’re not very proud of it. Our disappointment is greater than the “if you’re not embarrassed by your initial release…” disappointment because we should know better, being fans of Formstack’s “<a href="http://www.formstack.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page/">The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page</a>.” So we’ll be launching an improved landing page this week.</p>

<p>For the current week we set the goal to launch a Google AdWords campaign to drive traffic to our <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">landing page</a>. The goal being to recruit ten beta users. We ran into a snag when our initial ads were rejected due to our mentioning a trademark in the ad. Those issues were addressed but Google’s three business day turn around time for ad review cost us half of the week. Despite the final goal, our hope was that we’d have validated some interest in our solution before we pitched the idea to the team.</p>

<h2>Concerns</h2>

<p>Velocity. Maybe it’s my experience as an entrepreneur but I’m not accustomed to having to build consensus before I can act and the process seems to slow me uncomfortably. THere’s also some education that has to take place. Innovating within a larger organization requires the patience of a teacher. Every team member brings different levels of experience and familiarity with the tenets of lean especially when applied to startups.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The goals for the coming week are…
</p><ul><li>Gather results from the <a href="http://bit.ly/Mam6uZ">marketing research survey</a>.</li>
<li>Launch improved <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">landing page</a>.</li>
<li>Complete cucumber specs for the MVP.</li>
<li>Run specs against existing code base to see what’s missing from the MVP.</li>
<li>Pitch project to the team.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/storage/igtm-base-assests/POSTER_SXSW_SD2.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1329097767734" class="right-image"/>
Last night I hosted a movie night at the Gaslight office to watch <a href="http://bit.ly/NJxdw1">&#8220;Indie Game: The Movie&#8221;</a>. I broadcasted invites across Twitter, reddit, and the user groups&#8217; mailing list I&#8217;m on. We ended up with 13 attend, five of whom were high school age or younger. I think there&#8217;s some potential to maybe have a regular Cincy Indie Game Dev meetup night.</p>

<p>The movie itself was pretty good. I enjoyed the intimate, behind the scenes look at the successful development of several games. We got to see early prototypes of &#8220;Braid&#8221; and the experiences that led up to it&#8217;s development. We got to see the iterative work on &#8220;Fez&#8221; and the cost of not shipping. We got to see the thought process behind &#8220;Super Meat Boy&#8221;. I really enjoyed getting to see how these guys worked. More than that though, the movie focuses on the emotional and psychological experiences of these developers as they go through multiple years of work on their projects.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t actually know very much about indie game dev, so I don&#8217;t know if the movie portrays a typical experience or not. The overall image it shows is the sole developer working too many hours in somewhat poor conditions. All of the developers highlighted struggled with depression of some kind induced by burnout and exhaustion. The movie made a specific point that to do this you had to make adverse trade-offs between your work and your life. As an outsider, I want to believe you can participate in indie game dev and still maintain work/life balance.</p>

<p>The coolest part of the evening was after the film. We had some great discussion about the movie itself, indie game dev in general, and factors affecting getting started. A couple of the teens demoed a game they had been working on. Vincent was just beginning to use <a href="http://impactjs.com/">impact.js</a>.  He had a ninja able to run and jump and almost land on a moving platform. He&#8217;d also hooked up some audio as well. It was a nice start with only a few hours of experimentation on his part.</p>

<p>A friend of Vincent&#8217;s (who&#8217;s name I sadly don&#8217;t remember), demoed a game he wrote last summer using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. It was a complete tutorial level for a fairly novel game concept. Being done in Unity, it was 3D, first person. The main hook was that you could rotate the world around you in order to make your way through the level. He said it took him most of the summer to build. The actual coding of the game wasn&#8217;t that much work. It was mainly the work he did on the menu system and the artwork.</p>

<p>I think we could get a handful of regular attendees for a monthly game dev group. It&#8217;d be good motivation to have something to demo and show. It&#8217;s also be good to talk about our experiences developing, problems we&#8217;re having and how to overcome them.</p>

<p>As a brief aside, I had downloaded the censored version of the movie from their website. Unfortunately, I had not screened the movie. Even being sensored, there was still quite a bit of content I wish I hadn&#8217;t projected up on the wall for my and other kids. I work in the indie software biz to some extent and know the coarseness most of us have, so I&#8217;m not really surprised. I think indie game dev is a great way to attract kids to programming. At least one of the scenes would have been very uncomfortable to watch if there had been any young women in the group. I wish the film had been more sensitive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>Last month’s meeting of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-Lean-Startup-Circle/">Cincinnati Lean Startup Circle</a> was probably my favorite thus far. The turn out was larger than normal but the reason for my enthusiasm was the level of engagement of the entrepreneurs who showed up. There were many interesting ideas discussed openly which was refreshing.</p>

<p>For me, a highlight of the meeting was the announcement of <a href="https://twitter.com/rywalker">Ryan Walker</a>’s newest venture, <a href="http://engagement.io/">Engagement.io</a>, a product intended “to help busy app owners or app developers get a system in place to not only track the engagement level of each of their users, but provide a tool to react to user activity and inactivity.” Better still, Ryan intends to blog weekly about his progress. If you’re interested in reading along simply visit <a href="http://engagement.io/"></a><a href="http://engagement.io/"></a><a href="http://engagement.io/"><a href="http://engagement.io/">http://engagement.io/</a></a>.</p>

<h2>Challenge Accepted</h2>

<p>For the past year I’ve wanted to do the same with my pet project, <a href="http://budgetsketch.com/">BudgetSketch</a>, but &lt;insert favorite excuse here&gt;. Recently at Gaslight we’ve begun to formalize how we’re building internal projects. The team didn’t hesitate a moment when I asked permission to blog about the customer development process we’re following on our newest product, <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">PaidSimply</a>. So I’m happy to be matching Ryan’s commitment and intend to blog weekly about our progress with PaidSimply.</p>

<h2>Intrapreneurism at Gaslight</h2>

<p>Gaslight was founded as a consultancy specializing in custom application development. We frequently write software for internal use and occasionally this software exhibits signs of external value, AKA “a business opportunity.” We’ve been working to diversify our revenue streams and adding products to the mix meets that goal nicely. The challenge will be to grow the products branch of our company without negatively impacting our consulting business. Thus far, when there have been conflicts (mostly scheduling) we have erred on the side of favoring consulting over product development.</p>

<p>To truly be lean we’ll have to discover a means of increasing our velocity or “rate of learning” if you will. The plan is to secure commitment to product development within Gaslight by presenting a clear path to sustainability. <a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/">Ash Maurya</a>’s <a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/2012/02/why-lean-canvas/">Lean Canvas</a> approach fits that need very nicely. We selected the Lean Canvas over Alex Osterwalder’s original <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas">Business Model Canvas</a> because we felt that the former is well suited to early stage startups and the latter better suited to those in later stages. It will be a simple step to move from the Lean Canvas to the Business Model Canvas for those products that reach maturity.</p>

<h2>PaidSimply</h2>

<p>Like many consultancies we invoice clients frequently via <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks</a> but we and our clients were feeling some pain regarding collecting on those invoices. Chief among these was that clients wishing to pay via credit card were forced to do so via PayPal which currently caps single transactions at $10,000. With minimal effort we felt we could significantly reduce that pain with <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, a service that allows us to collect payment via credit and debit card without transaction limits.</p>

<p>To test our solution we wrote a simple app that ties Freshbooks and Stripe together using their APIs such that once payment is received via Stripe the associated client invoice is marked as paid within Freshbooks. Not only did the test succeed in significantly reducing our pain but several clients who paid invoices using our solution mentioned their interest in using it for their invoicing needs. <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">PaidSimply</a> was born.</p>

<h2>PaidSimply’s Lean Canvas</h2>

<p>Following the process detailed in Ash’s book, <a href="http://www.runningleanhq.com/">Running Lean</a> we have documented our assumptions on PaidSimply’s Lean Canvas and present it below for your feedback in the comments below. We have thoughts as to the riskiest parts of the canvas but we’re eager to hear unbiased thoughts from our readership. So we won’t mention them at this point but by all means let us know what you think by commenting below.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>As mentioned, we plan to blog weekly about our experiences building PaidSimply. Our goals for this week include the following:<br/></p><ul><li>launch the landing page for beta <a href="https://app.paidsimply.com/">signups</a> (which should be completed if you’re reading this!)</li>
<li>run a Google AdWords campaign to recruit 10 beta users outside our sphere of contacts</li>
<li>walk through the existing app and write stories (using <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>) to document an MVP for use by our beta users</li>
</ul><p>We felt we could easily sign up 10 beta users from our clients and their contacts but felt we’d benefit from having users from diverse business domains. The Cucmber stories will be used not only to develop the app but to demonstrate to the Gaslight team that the MVP is achievable and capable of generating revenue quickly (the best form of validation!). This should increase buy-in by the team and secure the thumbs up needed to proceed with the project, or this will be a very short series of blog posts! The plan is to have all the steps above completed by next weeks blog post. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7euvjwG8Q1r9fv8b.png" class="left-image"/>We had a discussion this morning about password management and what is secure. I felt compelled to write something about what I believe to be the best mix of simplicity and security. In short, use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>.</p>

<p>So the primary argument against 1Password is that it&#8217;s not secure enough. The main alternative presented was having a small handful of passwords memorized. Each password is of differing levels of security: one easy to remember and type for sites you don&#8217;t care about progressing up to one very secure password you only use on a handful of sites.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this strategy that I can see. First, sharing passwords between sites is a bad idea. All sites will eventually have their password databases stolen. Any other assumption feels too risky to me. The trick is that organizations are not required to divulge when they have security breaches. You could have your super-strong password cracked at your bank and not know it. So you don&#8217;t know your other accounts are vulnerable until the site discloses.</p>

<p>So when your bank&#8217;s password db is stolen you&#8217;re going to have to go change your password on all the other sites that share your super-strong password. Here&#8217;s the second problem: you may not remember which sites are using this super-strong password.</p>

<p>So how secure is 1Password? Agile Bits has written a nice article on the <a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/agile_keychain_design.html">Agile Keychain Design</a> that describes all their security decisions. The short of it is 1Password is using AES-128 as implemented open source by Apple in their OpenSSL CommonCrypto library.</p>

<p>After doing a little research (which means reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Wikipedia Page on AES</a>) I do not believe there are any known direct breaks on AES that are realistically feasible. Of course, this makes me sound like a security expert, which I am not. There are several known attacks, but the attacks still require a crazy amount of time.</p>

<p>The real risk of attacks come from &#8220;side-channels&#8221;, which means attacking the way the algorithm is implemented in software. There have been several successful attacks against AES side-channels. However, since the attacks are against the implementation and not the algorithm, libraries are able to patch security releases to mitigate if not alleviate the risk.</p>

<p>What does 1Password buy you over other password management strategies? In short, your list of passwords and which sites you use them on is available on all of your devices: Mac desktop, iPhone, iPad, even Windows desktop and Android. By storing your encrypted keychain in Dropbox, you can painlessly sync your passwords across all of these devices. Having a single, very secure password to access the keychain provides solid security in a convenient format.</p>

<p>This will allow you to generate unique, secure passwords for each site you visit. All of the sites that you feel require a secure password can have one that is unique. If you choose to share weaker passwords between low-risk sites, 1Password will also allow you to easily search how many sites are using that shared password.</p>

<p>I guess in the end, I don&#8217;t really care how you choose to manage your passwords. If you feel what you&#8217;re doing is secure enough for your risk tolerance, then I have nothing to add. The point of this post is that I find 1Password to be both convenient and secure. If you&#8217;re not satisfied with your password management strategy I suggest you give it a try.</p>
