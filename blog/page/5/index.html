<h2 class="embedded-subtitle">An Interview with <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/kclasita">Kristin Lasita</a></strong>, Gaslight’s Newest Branding Star</h2>
<h2>You’re a native of Cincinnati, what’s it like to grow up, go to college and start work here?</h2>
<p><img class="left-image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7a8ztQPVb1r9fv8b.png"/> I grew up traveling around the country. By the end of high school I was ready to get out, if not the state then at least the city. On a whim I applied to DAAP at UC. I had always liked art in high school and getting to come up with creative solutions to problems. My original plan was to major in international communication so I’d get to travel. When I did get my acceptance to DAAP, it was hard to turn it down. I had a couple friends going to DAAP as well, so it seemed perfect.</p>
<p>Long story short, I decided to take the chance at design school and I’m so glad I did. I was able to live all across the country, buy pretty paper and not books, and stay up all night trying to make everything just right. By traveling away from Cincinnati, it made me appreciate it more. Sure it’s not San Fran, but it has it’s own charm. I even had someone tell me they had heard Cincinnati was cool, when I told someone my hometown. Who would have thought that?</p>
<p>Staying in town was really a financial situation: I have some loans and parents who are kind enough to let me live at home. Cheap cost of living is a huge plus, but so is the city itself. I was thinking, if Cincinnati has changed so much in 5 years, I don’t want to miss what they can do in the next 5. I even thought I might be a part of influence of change, so I’ll have to get back to you on that success.</p>
<h2>As a recent DAAP graduate, how do you feel about your decision to go to Art School versus just starting work?</h2>
<p><img class="right-image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7b4ebTU7r1r9fv8b.png"/> For me, college wasn’t a choice, it was expected. Nowadays, it almost feels like you have to have a college degree to get a job.</p>
<p>Although I’m glad that I went to school for design, I can see where it isn’t necessary. There are plenty of talented and passionate people out there who have the drive to succeed. I just never had this until I really got started in school.</p>
<p><img class="left-image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7a9dh5mBe1r9fv8b.png"/> The first three years of school were a kick in the butt. I did a series of seemingly, to me, meaningless exercises: painting a grey scale, one drop of black paint at a time, drawing keys, and putting together boxes. Looking back, I had many Aha moments that really drove home that actually getting something for the thousands I paid. I didn’t just learn how to properly set a magazine page, I learned how design surrounds us. I can see the concepts in well designed clothes to motorcycles.</p>
<p>So is college right? For some people, like me, yes. For passionate people that know what they love off the bat? Not necessary.</p>
<h2>What is one of your favorite DAAP experiences?</h2>
<p><img class="right-image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7aasmRKLL1r9fv8b.png"/> If you haven’t gathered yet, I love to travel. With a mom working at Delta, I was able to fly for free all through school. With all my friends around the country, it was the perfect opportunity opportunity to see some cities I had never been to. LA, San Fran, New York, Pittsburgh, and Chicago were some cities I visited, while living in Boston and Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>So yeah…that wasn’t technically in DAAP.</p>
<h2>What’s your first full week at Gaslight been like?</h2>
<p><img class="left-image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7aarxgS8S1r9fv8b.png"/> One word: different.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve worked for design firms, doing anything from the field wall for the Orange Bowl, to company holiday cards. This is a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>But in general, it seems like I’ll be learning a lot, but also helping to make things a little prettier. Everyone has been very, very nice and I’ve had some very,very not nice workplace experiences. It’s interesting actually seeing how websites work, rather than just designing after the fact. The back-end is just as creative as front-end.</p>
<p>Also the atmosphere is very different, but nice. “What are my hours?” “Well, about nine to five, but if something happens let us know”. It’s nice to not have some faceless boss, who doesn’t know your name.</p>
<p>Overall: been good and we’ll see where the future weeks take us.</p>
<h2>Outside of Design and Art, what else do you like doing?</h2>
<p>I’m pretty laid back. My favorite past-time is reading a book in the sun. For rainy days, I’m excellent on Mario Kart for the N64. I like to cook visually balanced dishes and drink delicious margaritas.</p>
<p>I’m also really good at eating cookies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently email is still a valid way of sharing things. It may still be the best way of sharing something with one person. Every social media app has an api for &#8220;share&#8221; buttons, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a whole lot of code out there to steal in the way of email sharing buttons. So if you have a Tumblr blog like this one, and can run some Ruby, steal this script if you like:</p>

<p><br/></p>

<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/3074150.js?file=generate_email_button_html.rb">https://gist.github.com/3074150.js?file=generate_email_button_html.rb</a></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The output is html that you can paste into your custom Tumblr theme. An anchor tag, with a mailto action, that wraps a button image. You&#8217;ll need to replace the value of &#8220;image_url&#8221; in the script ( the one here is locked down by s3 ). The rest may work out just fine for you.</p>

<p>The email copy is uri-encoded and passed as the value to the &#8220;body&#8221; parameter in the mailto query string. The interface to the mailto scheme is pretty limited. I quit in my attempt to get any multipart html/text email stuff going on. The RFC states &#8220;The mailto URL is primarily intended for generation of short text messages that are actually the content of automatic processing (such as &#8220;subscribe&#8221; messages for mailing lists), not general MIME bodies.&#8221; So, yeah.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also pretty aware that I&#8217;m hacking the mailto scheme by putting a space where the &#8220;to&#8221; value should go. The idea is that an email client will pop up in a draft mode with the &#8220;to&#8221; field empty, so that the article sharer can fill it in. I got the result I wanted, but the execution seems shady.</p>

<p>Leave comments. I&#8217;m interested in better ways to do this, or ideas around how to acheive richer email messages from a share by email button.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re struggling to wrap your head around Hypermedia APIs, the first thing you need to understand is that you actively use one every day. Unless you were just handed a printout of this article, you are using one right now.</p>

<h3>The Twilight Zone</h3>

<p>Imagine that you live in an alternate dimension. You want to do some online shopping, and you have just received the latest Amazon.com client. You fire it up and do a product search for “Three’s Company DVDs”. All of the product data comes down the wire. We have the names, brands, and prices of the twenty most relevent “Three’s Company” related products. After the client gets the data, it goes to work! It builds all of the urls and applies them onto all of the product data that came down, so that you can click on the DVD set that you like. Wait, no! The client doesn’t do that!</p>

<p>To anybody with a passing amount of knowledge about how to build a website, the situation above seems ridiculous. In this dimension, we have a web browser that knows how to read a representation of data called HTML, and render and activate the links that the server provides in that document. The server defines where the resources reside, so naturally, the server provides the links to those resources.</p>

<h3>We Didn’t Know Any Better</h3>

<p>My alternate universe attempted to describe a scenario in which the web that we know and love operates like an API that I designed last year. I think a lot of people design APIs in this way, i.e. they do what they need to do right now. They provide some locations on their server that allow a third party to read or write to some resources. That doesn’t sound so bad, right? An API totally needs to do those things, but it needs to do a little bit more. APIs are by definition publicly available, they invite themselves into a realm of of other people’s stuff that you no longer have total control over. As such, some forethought needs to be given to design up front. APIs that only provide the resources, and not the locations to next resource, are taking the short view and are introducing big problems for the future evolution of your system.</p>

<p>The fatal flaw will smack you soon enough. When you rolled out the API, you promised all of the people, in your meticulously crafted documentation, that the resource they want is available at location x. They, in turn, built clients around that promise, and now you badly, badly need to change that location to y. Go ahead and update that documentation and see how much it helps. Best case scenario is that you built the client, and now you have to get everybody to update it before you can get back to doing anything productive on your end. To quote <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a>, “People are really good at screwing themselves over in the long term”.</p>

<h3>Robots Like to Surf The Web Too</h3>

<p>So what’s the solution? Let’s bring it back to the web to understand how we can address this. Grandma has a home page with a link people can click on to see pictures of all of her perfect grandchildren. Six months later Grandma finds a cheaper site for hosting those pictures and wants to put them there instead. As Grandma’s faithful webmaster, you update the link on her homepage to point to the new photo sharing site. Does the whole world need to update their web client now? Of course not, the link to the next resource is defined and provided by the server in the HTML it sends down, and that link just changed. I think the best short description of an API I’ve found is in Ryan Tomako’s article <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife">“How I Explained REST to My wife”</a>. Paraphrasing, an API is an interface for machines to use the web just like people do. APIs that don’t employ hypermedia are basically jerks that are saying to clients, “I know where to go next, but I’m going to make you guess how to get there anyway.” With a Hypermedia API you force the client to know the location of exactly one resource, “Home”.</p>

<p>So applying Hypermedia to APIs provides solutions, but also really transforms the very nature of the interaction into something much cooler. APIs whose resources link to other resources become “engines of application state”. Every resource exposes it’s current state, and the paths that you can take to create, interact with, and shape it. When an API describes to you how to interact with it, clients can be designed in a static way, reactively handling changes from the server.</p>

<h3>Hypermedia APIs in Practice</h3>

<p>So how do you go about acheiveing this? Unfortunatley, I have little practical experience to share. I understand a few things. People who talk about REST, talk about nouns and verbs. All APIs provide the nouns, Hypermedia APIs provide the verbs too. In addition to the data the APIs traditionally provide, at every step of the way they need to describe, with links, 1) where to start 2) where you are, and 3) where you can go next.</p>

<p>There are definitely some best practices around things like content negotation and media types that you can read up on, but I gather from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cdmwebs">Chris Moore</a> that it’s still the Wild West for Hypermedia design. Apparently making more effective use of HTTP Headers is good design, and you want to give some thought about your content format, because types like JSON and XML are not implicitly hypermedia aware, i.e. they have no baked in concept of links.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>While I’m talking about what I do know, maybe it’s a good time to mention where I learned it. The impetus for all of this was <a href="https://vimeo.com/44520801">this talk</a> given by Steve Klabnik at the most recent <a href="http://cincyrb.com/">Cincy.rb</a> meetup, just a couple weeks ago. Steve’s done a ton of writing and speaking around this subject, just google him or pick up his evolving book, <a href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">“Designing Hypermedia APIs”</a>. The talk is an overview of what Hypermedia APIs are, why they’re important, and their philosophical implications. Thankfully, Steve gives us permissions to stop worrying and fighting about REST and focus on cool stuff. For the Rails folks, Steve recommends two gems, <a href="https://github.com/josevalim/active_model_serializers/">active_model_serializers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spastorino/rails-api">rails-api</a></p>

<p>I also highly recommend this <a href="https://vimeo.com/20781278">video presentation</a> by Jon Moore, in which he actually demos a static client. If this link between Hypermedia APIs and the web as we know it is still nebulous, this video will solidify it for you. I really like the way Jon explains things and boils down the dissertation language, translating a block of Fielding into “You do stuff by reading pages and then either following links or submitting forms.”.</p>

<p>For some deep reading, I’ve heard people recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Hypermedia-APIs-HTML5-Node/dp/1449306578">“Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node”</a>. Don’t worry if you’re not a node programmer. I also want to give a shout to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cdmwebs/">Chris Moore</a>, who’s been our resident Hypermedia API pusher, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SeanTAllen">Sean Allen</a>, who’s been harping to me about REST since before harping about REST was cool.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you need inspiration in understanding hypermedia APIs, look no further than the web. The architecture and protocols for the web were designed by really smart guys who already figured this stuff out a long time ago and can be applied universally. Once I started viewing APIs through the lense of the web I know and love, it actually seems completely wrong to design one in any other way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE 7/31/2012:</strong> As mentioned below, I spent some time at BackboneConf talking with <a href="%5Bhttp://alexsexton.com/">Alex Sexton</a> about third-party javascript. He had been one of the early technical reviewers for <a href="http://bit.ly/thirdparty-js">Third-Party Javascript</a> by Ben Vinegar and Anton Kovalyov. Alex had nothing but good stuff to say about this book. I&#8217;ve only read a little of it through Manning&#8217;s Early Access Program. I think Ben and Anton really know what they&#8217;re talking about and bring a lot of experience to this subject. I look forward to finishing their book.</p>

<h1>What I&#8217;ve Learned from Third-Party Javascript</h1>

<p>I am not the foremost JavaScript developer on our team. In fact, I consider myself more of a back-end developer than front-end. That&#8217;s a little ironic given that I have more than a year&#8217;s experience developing backbone.js web client applications. The last couple weeks have thrown me into a new realm of JavaScript development: third party libraries.</p>

<h2>A New Level of Rigor</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re developing a software serviced used by our clients by including JavaScript onto their pages. This raised issues I had not considered much on previous JavaScript projects. The responsibility of injecting Javascript into an application you don&#8217;t own brings on a whole new level of rigor:</p>

<ul><li>You have to be very careful not to pollute the global namespace and also not to rely on anything from the global namespace. </li>
<li>More than ever, you have to pay attention to the size of your application as delivered to the client&#8217;s page. </li>
<li>You have to be more diligent about memory management. </li>
</ul><p>What&#8217;s the solution? The initial version of the project took a very no-nonsense approach: do as little as you can get away with using straight-up JavaScript and the standard libraries shipped with the browsers. That was probably a good decision given the early stage of the project and the modest functionality required. However, the new features required a lot more sophistication.</p>

<h2>Use Good Practices</h2>

<p>First and foremost, good software is still good software. I think there&#8217;s a lot of temptation to allow your JavaScript to grow in unmanageable ways. Keeping your code modular is still the right thing to do. Follow the principle of single responsibility. Create objects that do one thing and are well tested.</p>

<p>For me, mainly because I&#8217;m not a great JavaScript developer, I rely on CoffeeScript&#8217;s classes. I don&#8217;t think they are the most pure way of creating JavaScript objects; particularly after reading Crockford&#8217;s <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>. However, they are easy for me to understand and implemented well. Coming from a Ruby background, using CoffeeScript classes and Jasmine specs maps well to my experience.</p>

<h2>Get Small</h2>

<p>What I quickly learned though, is that writing native JavaScript is hard. I&#8217;ve learned to lean so heavily on JQuery and other fantastically rich libraries, it was hard for me to fall back to working without them. After some work, I was able to relearn how to access the DOM natively and even to some extent events handling. It was a lot of work though and tricky to test.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to give up on libraries for help just because JQuery is huge. There are many microframeworks to fill specific niches. Once we started trying to deal with events on our own it became clear we should be using some microframework to help. We settled on Bean and Qwery. We also decided on 140medly for help with ajax requests. I found the site <a href="http://microjs.com">http://microjs.com</a> pretty nifty for exploring what&#8217;s out there.</p>

<h2>Stay Out of The Way</h2>

<p>The question becomes, how do you include these libraries into your application without polluting the global namespace or colliding with existing versions that may already be on the window? The answer is that it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ve got the right solution yet.</p>

<p>We ended up creating a single global on the window for our application. We then downloaded and edited the libraries we were using to have them insert themselves into our namespace rather than onto the window. I feel reasonably confident that our global object won&#8217;t collide with anything on the client&#8217;s page. It would be better if we didn&#8217;t add ourselves to the global space at all, but it&#8217;s a compromise with simplicity I&#8217;m willing to make. Editing vendor JavaScript isn&#8217;t that cool, but for expediency I&#8217;m okay with it for now too.</p>

<h2>Stay Tuned In</h2>

<p>This week though, I was fortunate enough to go to Backbone Conf in Boston, MA. I spent some time talking with <a href="https://github.com/SlexAxton">Alex Sexton</a> about require.js. At this point, I feel like I should try to rebuild my little library with require.js and see how it feels. Being a Rails guy, it&#8217;s pretty easy to lean on the asset pipeline (Sprokets), but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s really the best solution. I&#8217;ll post some more once I experiment a little.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Happy JavaScripting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We recently witnessed an email conversation between a local student entrepreneur, Paul Baechtold (<a href="http://twitter.com/Paul_Baechtold">@Paul_Baechtold</a>), and gaslight&#8217;s very own Lean Startup authority, Bill Barnett (<a href="http://twitter.com/agilous">@agilous</a>).</p>

<p>The content speaks for itself and requires little introduction. We thought the conversation sparked by Paul, and the advice that follows, was both valuable and universal. If you have a great idea, and the drive to make it a reality, but are stifled by uncertainty about where and how to start, read on.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>From: Paul Baechtold</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am a student-entrepreneur at Miami University looking to start a tech start-up, but unfortunately am lacking in the development aspect of the idea. I think I have an idea with huge potential, and really just need a talented developer or two to get it up and running. I hope to then apply to incubators across the country once the platform is live. Would love to hear back from someone if there is any interest in learning more about the idea. Thanks!</p>
  <p><br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>From: Bill Barnett</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello Paul,</p>

  <p>We love talking with entrepreneurs. Believe it or not, the first thing
  we typically do when speaking with them is try to convince them that
  they’re not ready for custom software. This may seem odd given that we
  make our living primarily writing custom software for our clients but
  unless the relationship we have with our clients is mutually
  beneficial chances are we’ll both wind up unhappy with the outcome.</p>

  <p>Let’s discuss that “mutually beneficial” part. For our part, we’re
  confident that we can provide quality software. We’ve done so for
  established companies in the Bay area to startups in our own backyard.
  What we’re concerned about is building the highest quality software
  that no one will ever use. Ensuring that your idea, your vision is of
  value to enough users to merit its construction is your part.</p>

  <p>We’re big fans of the lean startup movement and as much as it pains us
  to say it, often the first thing to do with a startup idea is not to
  write code; it’s to state the assumptions about your idea, develop
  falsifiable hypotheses about those assumptions, and then test them
  rigorously.</p>

  <p>Still want to be an entrepreneur? We hope so because many of our best
  clients started right where you’re standing today. So how would we
  recommend that you proceed? We think you should read three books. They
  are:</p>

  <ul><li><a href="http://refer.ly/aaCv">“The Lean Startup” by Eric Ries</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://refer.ly/aaCu">“Running Lean” by Ash Maurya</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://refer.ly/aaCt">“The Startup Owner’s Manual” by Steve Blank</a></li>
  </ul><p>Given your stated goal, we can assure you that an entrepreneur with an
  idea that has been vetted using the processes documented in these
  books is far more attractive to tech incubators than a polished
  application that no one is using. We hope you’ll give serious
  consideration to this advice.</p>

  <p>Of course we’d still appreciate an opportunity to chat with you about
  your idea. If that sounds worthwhile to you just send me a reply or
  call my cellphone (listed below) and we’ll arrange for a chat. We wish
  you the best with your studies and with your career as an
  entrepreneur. I hope to have the opportunity to speak with you soon.</p>

  <p>Regards,</p>

  <p>Bill Barnett</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gaslight-blog/backbone.png"/></p>
<p class="p1">As soon as you build an interesting application in backbone, one
  of the challenges you are likely to encounter is wanting to have composite
  views, or views that are contained within a larger view.  I&#8217;ve solved
  this problem several ways in different projects and I thought it would be fun
  to walk through the progression and how I&#8217;ve arrived at what I
  currently see as a preferred solution.  </p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s start by talking about what might seem to be the most
  obvious solution and why it doesn&#8217;t actually work.  We&#8217;ll use as
  an example a view that displays a collection of people.  Let&#8217;s assume
  we&#8217;d like to have a view for the table and within it, views for each
  row.  You might end up with a TableView like so:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">With the template for it being:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view_template.haml"></script>

<p class="p2">I currently using haml_coffee as my favorite templating language.
   If you dig haml, it&#8217;s worth checking out.</p>
<p class="p2">Notice the tableRow method on TableView.  Because we pass the
  view itself into the template function, tableRow is available to us in the
  template.  In it we create a TableRow, render it, and then return it&#8217;s
  html.  Here&#8217;s what TableRowView and it&#8217;s template looks like</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view_no_events.coffee"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view_template.haml"></script>

<p class="p2">And initially it all appears to work well.  We see our table with
  a row for each person.  Great!  But now let&#8217;s try adding an event
  handler that pops up an alert when we click a table cell.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view_with_events.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">And what happens?  Precisely nothing.  What&#8217;s going on?
   The problem is that the TableRowView&#8217;s element never actually gets
  added to the DOM.  We create a TableRowView in the tableRow method of
  TableView, render into it&#8217;s element, and then pull out the row view
  elements html and shove it into the rendered output of TableView.  We grabbed
  the html, but TableRowView&#8217;s element never actually made it into the
  DOM.  That means event binding, jQuery plugins, and all kinds of stuff just
  won&#8217;t work.  Not good.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s try another approach:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view2.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">Here we&#8217;ve changed the tableRow method to not create the
  TableRowView at all, but instead to create a row element with an id.  We then
  add a second loop thru the collection at the end of render and create our
  TableRowView, passing in it&#8217;s element which we find using the id we
  gave it and then tell it to render.  Because the row view&#8217;s element is
  in the DOM at the time we create and render it, everything works.  When I
  first starting building complexish apps in backbone, this is how I generally
  did composite views.</p>
<p class="p1">But it&#8217;s pretty clunky.  We have a second loop thru the
  collection for one thing, and it just doesn&#8217;t feel very clean.  The
  code relating to adding rows is now in two different places, and the parent
  seems to have pretty intimate knowledge of how the child view works.</p>
<p class="p1">We can do better.  Backbone gives a powerful tool for decoupling
  in events, and we can use them here to make our code cleaner.  Let&#8217;s
  try another crack at TableView:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view3.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">As you can see, we&#8217;ve removed a good bit of code.
   We&#8217;ve gone back to creating our TableRowView in tableRow, but are now
  passing in reference to the TableView as a parentView property.  And we are
  no longer telling TableRowView when to render at all, instead we are
  broadcasting a &#8220;rendered&#8221; event that gives anyone who cares a
  chance to do whatever they need to do.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re also moving responsibility for when to render and
  what element to render into the TableRowView.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view2.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">It&#8217;s not necessarily less code overall, but the parent view
  is much less coupled to the child view.  The child view listens to the
  &#8220;rendered&#8221; event and then finds her element within the
  parent&#8217;s element.  And it seems to make sense for the child to do this,
  after all she is one best equipped to know how to locate her own element
  since she gave herself an id in the attributes method.  In case you
  haven&#8217;t seen this before, backbone will use tagName and attributes to
  build the element for a view if you don&#8217;t pass one in, which we
  don&#8217;t in the case of TableRowView.</p>
<p class="p1">The bit of this code that seems the least pleasant is the toHtml
  method.  This is an unfortunate hack to get the outerHtml for the element, as
  jQuery doesn&#8217;t seem to provide a more convenient way to do it.  Gentle
  reader, feel free to correct me if I&#8217;m wrong on this.</p>
<p class="p1">Overall though, I&#8217;m happier with this approach to composite
  views, so much so that I&#8217;ve extracted a lot of this into a base view
  class in my <a href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic"
    title="backtastic">backtastic</a> project.  I&#8217;ll get into lots more
  detail about backtastic in an upcoming post.</p>

How I Learned to Love Cincinnati<br/>or<br/>QCMerge: A Love Story
</h1>
</a>
<p>
For four months, I was lucky enough to be an insider to the planning and execution of the <a href="http://qcmerge.com">Queen City Merge Conference</a>, taking place just a few short weeks ago in downtown Cincinnati. This was the maiden voyage of the QCMerge, and I was privy to many of the small victories and defeats that come with planning a large event. Throwing a conference is very much an &#8220;if you build it, they will come&#8221; endeavor. I can tell you that the prospect of throwing in the towel was definitely on the table, on more than one occasion. However, the fight raged on, Queen City Merge was born, and and the City didn&#8217;t let us down.
</p>

<h2>
Play to Your City&#8217;s Strengths
</h2>
<p>
Queen City Merge was was inspired by Columbia SC&#8217;s <a href="http://convergese.com/">ConvergeSE</a>. The focus of the conference was building web businesses. For startups, that tends heavily towards design and marketing, and Cincinnati has a pretty impressive track record in that arena. This <a href="http://vimeo.com/42232649">video</a> was somewhat of an eye-opener for me. The gist of the video: Cincinnati brands permeate the globe, the City supports it&#8217;s startups and entrepreneurs, and it&#8217;s more awesome to live here. Lately, I think Cincinnati has been winning at reflecting some of that branding and marketing talent onto itself. 
</p>

<h2>
Make it Hip
</h2>
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/gaslight-blog/qcmerge2.png">
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/gaslight-blog/qcmerge11.png" style="float:right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 15px"/></a>
<p>
Branding is important to emerging business and, it turns out, emerging conferences. Even we were surprised by the tone that resulted when it all came together. The creative branding by GoDutch, re-imagined classic Alice in Wonderland, merging it with modern nerd culture. The location was a towering slab of concrete and glass smack in the middle of downtown Cincinnati. There was a White Stripes tribute band performing in front of a fifty-foot Shepard Fairey poster. To date, I have never heard people talk about food so much at a conference. Cool branding brings people to conferences; abundant local taste treats keep them coming back apparently. 
</p>

<h2>
Never say &#8220;Feedback&#8221;, But Always Get It
</h2>
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/gaslight-blog/qcmerge12.png" style="float:left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px"/><p>
Not to mention the speakers. The talks were really top-notch. The video will be available, but don&#8217;t worry, I can let you in on the lesson to online success right now. Get Feedback Fast. Talk to your customers, put faces and names to your users, watch people using your product, fail fast, and a/b test everything. Understand that the line between designers and developers is blurring, and should be. Understand that good talent is hard to find, but it&#8217;s out there, and it will come to a conference. And, oh yeah, never use the word &#8220;Feedback&#8221;.
</p>

<h2>
The Big Red Machine
</h2>
<p>
I come from a long line of crotchety cynics. I&#8217;m ashamed to say that for too long I&#8217;ve been victim to a &#8220;grass is greener&#8221; mentality. If I lived in Paris, I&#8217;d probably complain that it was too &#8220;magical&#8221;. But even cynical people yearn to live in cool place that they can show off. Who can be cynical after twenty minutes of unplanned fireworks, following a great event, and an evening of professional baseball by the river? Cincinnati is vibrant, and it&#8217;s influence on the conference was palpable. It&#8217;s a city where there are things happening, and there&#8217;s still room to be a big shot. It&#8217;s amazing how quickly that &#8220;grass is greener&#8221; mentality can flip, with a little exposure to people who believe that the grass is pretty damn green right here. I&#8217;m looking forward to next year, and all of the good stuff that is bound to happen in-between.

<time datetime="2012-05-23T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 23<span>rd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fresh on the heels of <a href="http://qcmerge.com/">QC Merge</a> I found myself en route to Grand Rapids for the region&#8217;s best kept secret, at least as far as lean startups are concerned, the <a href="http://momentum-mi.com/events/lean-conference/">Michigan Lean Startup Conference</a> (MLSC). The second year conference is sponsored by <a href="http://momentum-mi.com/">Momentum</a>, a Michigan-based seed stage accelerator. New this year was a day of workshops taught by <a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/">Ash Maurya</a>, <a href="http://market-by-numbers.com/">Brant Cooper</a>, and <a href="http://www.vlaskovits.com/">Patrick Vlaskovits</a>. In addition to the speakers, the event also offers regional entrepreneurs the ability to showcase their projects via lightening intros during breaks and at booths setup outside the conference room.</p>

<h2>Startup Luminaries</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Ries</a> himself spoke at last year&#8217;s inaugural event. The highlight of this year&#8217;s event was <a href="http://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank</a>&#8217;s presentation given via Skype. Aside from Steve&#8217;s talk, my personal favorites were the presentations by Ash (as a fellow bootstrapper, I&#8217;m a big fan of Ash&#8217;s), App Sumo&#8217;s <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagan</a>, and veteran MLSC presenter, <a href="http://www.danmartell.com/">Dan Martell</a> who was to speak in-person but also presented via Skype due to a travel snafu.</p>

<p>With luminairies like these it&#8217;s a mystery to me why this event is attracting primarily western Michigan attendees. The only exception I encountered was Bloomington-based entrepreneur <a href="http://nicktippmann.com/">Nick Tippmann</a> who I had met at <a href="http://brandery.org/">The Brandery</a>&#8217;s Office Hours a few weeks ago. I&#8217;d estimate there were about 200 attendees, about 30 of which attended the workshops the following day. The general consensus of the presentations was very positive, matching the energy level I sensed at last year&#8217;s event, and the workshops were equally we received.</p>

<h2>Just Like Last Year, Only Better!</h2>

<p>One contrast of significance from last year&#8217;s event was the caliber of entrepreneurs with whom I spoke. It seemed last year that the wantrepreneurs were everywhere. This year, everyone I spoke with seemed to have drunk the lean startup Kool-aid. This appraisal was born out not only by the appearance of &#8220;all the right words&#8221; in conversations but in-depth examinations during the workshops. Without exception, everyone I spoke to was proud to discuss the experiments they had run and the learning which resulted. What&#8217;s more, there wasn&#8217;t a stealth startup to be found.</p>

<h2>Bonus Material</h2>

<p>My weekend in Grand Rapids did not end there. Saturday the folks at <a href="http://atomicobject.com/">Atomic Object</a> hosted &#8220;User Experience for Lean Startups&#8221; presented by <a href="http://www.lanehalley.com/">Lane Halley</a> from <a href="http://luxr.co/">LUXr</a>. My main take aways from this workshop are to not underestimate the impact of visual learning (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/agilous/status/203854790302777344">clothespin man</a>!), and personas are powerful tools that serve both to flesh out facts about your product&#8217;s users and provide a concrete focal point for the product team.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m extremely envious of the MLSC and wish there was a similarly focused event here in Ohio. Fortunately, it&#8217;s not a long drive to Grand Rapids, even from my corner of the Buckeye state, and the commute takes me out of the local startup eco-system and offers an opportunity to share experiences and ideas with leaders from another. Kudos to the MLSC team for hosting a very informative event and hope to see you again next year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to expand my ruby toolset. The other day I had thirty minutes to try out ruby-debug and failed. I couldn&#8217;t get it operational, and I ended up <a href="http://blog.wyeworks.com/2011/11/1/ruby-1-9-3-and-ruby-debug">here</a> in a sad state of affairs. How could the ruby debugger be languishing in the latest ruby versions? I think last might I may have figured out why. The why is <a href="http://pry.github.com/">Pry</a>.</p>

<h2>A Live State and Code Explorer</h2>

<p>Calling up Pry reminded me of my sweet, sweet, beloved Smalltalk. If you&#8217;re not familiar, Smalltalk is a magical land of rainbows and hot-air balloons, where objects dance and sing, and you can munch bite-sized clouds of cotton-candy code all day long. Developing in Smalltalk, exploring the state and protocol of live objects is simple and embedded and constant. It&#8217;s all about digging in and discovery, and Pry lets you do that ( sans mouse to boot ).

</p><h2>A Pry Story</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m learning cucumber. I writing step definitions in this DSL and it feels a little like a foreign land. In my step definitions, I have objects like &#8220;page&#8221; available to me and I don&#8217;t even know what they are. And I wouldn&#8217;t care, until I&#8217;m trying test the contents of a Google calendar embedded in an iframe, complicated.</p>

<p>So I want to explore &#8220;page&#8221;. I put the line below in my step definition:</p>

<pre><code>pry page</code></pre>

<p>Then, running cucumber invoked the Pry REPL:</p>

<pre><code>pry(#&lt;Capybara::Session&gt;)&gt;</code></pre>

<p>So it turns out &#8220;pages&#8221; are Cabybara::Sessions. What methods can I call on them?</p>

<pre><code>pry(#&lt;Capybara::Session&gt;)&gt; ls</code></pre>

<pre><code>Capybara::Session#methods: all  app
attach_file  body  check  choose  cleanup!  click_button  click_link
click_link_or_button  click_on  current_host  current_path  current_url
document  driver  evaluate_script  execute_script  field_labeled  fill_in  find
find_button  find_by_id  find_field  find_link  first  has_button?
has_checked_field?  has_content?  has_css?  has_field?  has_link?
has_no_button?  has_no_checked_field?  has_no_content?  has_no_css?
has_no_field?  has_no_link?  has_no_select?  has_no_selector?  has_no_table?
has_no_unchecked_field?  has_no_xpath?  has_select?  has_selector?  has_table?
has_unchecked_field?  has_xpath?  html  inspect  mode  reset!  reset_session!
response_headers  save_and_open_page  save_page  select  source  status_code
text  uncheck  unselect  visit  wait_until  within  within_fieldset
within_frame  within_table  within_window
self.methods: __binding_impl__
instance variables: @app  @document  @driver  @mode  @scopes
locals: _  _dir_  _ex_  _file_  _in_  _out_  _pry_
</code></pre>

<p>(This actually looks like a Smalltalk class definition to me.)</p>
<p>Browsing the protocol&#8230;&#8221;body&#8221; looks about right:</p>

<div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;color:black;background:white;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">  pry(<span style="color: #808080">#&lt;Capybara::Session&gt;)&gt; body</span>
    <span style="color: #303030">=&gt;</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">"&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span><span style="color: #606060; font-weight: bold; background-color: #fff0f0">\n</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;</span><span style="color: #606060; font-weight: bold; background-color: #fff0f0">\n</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&lt;meta http-equiv=</span><span style="color: #606060; font-weight: bold; background-color: #fff0f0">\"</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0">Content-Type</span><span style="color: #606060; font-weight: bold; background-color: #fff0f0">\"</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0"> content=</span><span style="color: #606060; font-weight: bold; background-color: #fff0f0">\"</span>...</pre></div>

<p>That&#8217;s what I needed to get to. So in three quick steps I figured out:</p>

<ol><li> the class of &#8220;page&#8221;
  </li><li> what methods I could call on &#8220;page&#8221;
  </li><li> the current state &#8220;page&#8221;
</li></ol><h2>Coding Through Discovery</h2>

<p>And that&#8217;s everything I wanted to know. The beautiful thing is that never did I have to scour through API documentation to figure out the the simplest use-cases for this class. The output is clean and the environment is optimized for discovery.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m only scratching the surface here. As a runtime-invoked REPL and debugger, it&#8217;s certainly doing the trick. But I&#8217;ve gathered another huge part of what Pry provides is good tools for source and documentation browsing. Pry&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;Get to the code&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Pry and Rails</h2>

<p>You can use Pry in place of rails console by loading your rails app&#8217;s environment into Pry like:</p>
<div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;color:black;background:white;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
  pry -r ./config/environment
</pre></div>

<p>I&#8217;m really interested in exploring the ability to call pry from within the context of a running Rails app. I&#8217;m not sure if this is a thing, it would be so helpful to pop up a pry REPL from, say, a controller action. Believe me, I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

<p>Oh, and pry remembers my command history between sessions, *cough* irb.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t speak to ruby-debug, maybe it does similar things, but I suspect the reason it failed to install for me is that everyone&#8217;s discovered Pry. You should too. Thanks @p9k for re-kindling my interest in this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes you just get fed up with your broke-ass environment and you need to start over. Despite best intentions, you temporarily lose your vigilence, and you end up with macports and homebrew on your machine at the same time. Strange poltergeists creep into your machine and start warning you about Nokogiri every time you execute rails. Command-T completely refuses to work for no good reason, and you become suspicious, which&#8217;ing and &#8212;version&#8217;ing every call. Your home dir has accumulated so much junk, tab completion has become useless.</p>

<p>Stop the insanity. Nuke it all. And by nuke, I mean delete everything and re-install OS X. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of starting from scratch, and the best thing about nuking is, the more you do it, the easier it is. My latest foray has been my finest to date, thanks to a short consultation with Chris Moore (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cdmwebs">@cdmwebs</a>), a connessuier of nuking the things.</p>

<p>After moving all my keeper stuff offshore, to Dropbox or whanot, I wiped out my hard drive and reinstalled Lion ( hold Command-R during restart ). I did the Mac setup stuff and once I was able to hit Safari, I found myself installing a few desktop apps, 1Password was needed almost immediately. Shout-out to SizeUp, apparently I can&#8217;t live without it either.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t import all of my old 1Password data back in, because, surprisingly, my 1Password was also a horrific mess. So my strategy is to pull things from offshore as I realize I need them, which is rarely. More often than not, I find myself just resetting all of my online passwords, it&#8217;s easier than importing and it doesn&#8217;t seem like a terrible practice.</p>

<p>My next step was to start using Time Machine. I&#8217;ve stopped using it in the past because I was doing it wrong. At this point in the process, it seemed pretty essential to be able to roll back because installing code is like adding salt, it&#8217;s very easy to do it, not so much the reverse.</p>

<p>The big exciting next step, on Chris&#8217;s suggestion, was to install <a href="http://www.atmos.org/cinderella/">Cinderalla for Mac OSX</a> ( previously Cider ). I was really hoping this was going to work out, and it did. It only required Xcode, so I installed the latest.</p>

<p>Cinderella is a gem, that utilizes homebrew and chef to install all of the things. Namely: Ruby, Python, Node, Erlang, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Riak, Elastic Search, Memcached, and MongoDB. Do I need all of those things? No. Do I need one third of them? Almost. Have I worked with some of these things in the past, and do I not wholly reject using any of them in the future? Yes. Do I respect the idea of some of these things and fantasize about someday becoming the master of them? Yes. Would I like to just set this thing to run for a couple hours and play games on my iPhone? Yes. Carry on.</p>

<p>So I immediately encountered some sad stuff on attempting to install the gem. The issue and fix are outlined <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/191688">here</a>. Look for the post by cpeterson, in which you install &#8220;Command Line Tools&#8221; via an Xcode menu.</p>

<p>Once that was cleared up, it took a while, but with two commands Cinderella installed and set up all of those things, not to mention homebrew and rbenv, and put it all in ~/Developer. Quite tidy.</p>

<p>Cinderella finished, I cloned one of our Rails projects, did some obligatory setup and was running it without issue. Validated, I&#8217;ve just implemented Chris&#8217;s final pro-tip, which was to version all of my dot files. I&#8217;ve just commited and pushed my vim, bash, and git configs.</p>

<p>I love how the last step is already preparing me for the inevitable, I can hardly wait to nuke again. When you&#8217;ve come to terms with the fact, like me, that you are a messy piggy of a developer sometimes, or you accept the fact that you&#8217;re still trying to get a handle on Unix best practices, just resolve to become really good at cleaning your pen.</p>
