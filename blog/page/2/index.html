  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris Nelson&#8217;s been busy!</p>

<p>In early November, Chris gave a talk at Ruby Conf &#8220;<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1316-rubyconf2012-machine-learning-for-fun-and-profit-the-story-of-how-my-customer-wrote-my-code">Machine learning for fun and profit: the story of how my customer wrote my code</a>&#8221;. In it, Chris delves into decision trees, when they are appropriate tools, and their implementation in Ruby. In domains that implement overwhelming numbers of conditional rules that can be expressed as tabular data, decision tree algorithms can be utilized to determine outcomes instead of writing tons of conditional logic.</p>

<p>In late November, Elizabeth Naramore interviewed Chris on the Engine Yard Podcast, <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/podcast/gaslight-qcmerge-mastering-backbone">Cloud Out Loud</a>. Elizabeth and Chris talked about what we do at Gaslight and his <a href="http://www.masteringbackbone.com/">Mastering Backbone</a> training class. They talk about Chris&#8217;s latest open source project <a href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic">Backtastic</a>, which aims to make building forms in a Rails-backed Backbone app easier and more enjoyable. They talk about how the <a href="http://qcmerge.com/">QCMerge</a> conference, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-Web-Tech-Drinkup/">Web Tech Drinkup</a>, and <a href="http://gaslight.co/coffee">Gaslight Coffee</a> have revitalized the developer community in Cincinnati. Give it a listen if you&#8217;re interested in hearing details about what Chris has been working on, and the kinds of projects we&#8217;ve been working on at Gaslight!</p>

<p>Keep up the good work Chris!</p>

<p>
We were all pretty impressed when our &#8220;Artist in Residence&#8221;, Tammy Gambrel, showed off the work she had been doing with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook-pro-for-ipad/id364253478?mt=8">Sketchbook Pro</a> on her iPad. I met Tammy some years ago, but I had never gotten an idea of the depth of her experience, and her diversity of her talents until I sat down with her recently.
</p>

<p>
Tammy received degrees in Fine Art and Art History, but ironically, she got her foot in the door of the elusive world of professional art by taking a job as a&#8230;stock trader! It led to an accounting job at the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, where she quickly climbed the ranks to planning and hosting fundraising events. It was at the CAC that she met the people who gave her the inspiration to open her own gallery called Pivot, where artists such as herself could gain the exposure they desperately needed. Because first and foremost, Tammy has been a legitimate painter who&#8217;s held solo shows at prestigious galleries like the Carnegie in Covington, and sold work to the likes of Courtney Love.
</p>

<p>
Although Tammy&#8217;s exploits in the art world were comparatively successful, living as an artist is hard for all but a very slim percentage of people. After being out of the art world for a bit, Tammy is really excited about the prospect of being creative again at Gaslight. She is experimenting with ways that she can bring a painter&#8217;s eye and skill set to the historically geometric world of the web.
</p> 

<p>
Honestly, it&#8217;s been a bit of a culture shock. She still finds herself cringing sightly at words like &#8220;slicing&#8221;, and is still a little leery of practices the web world takes for granted. Repurposing photos pulled from the web at large, for example.
</p>

<p>
Although she had been a little dismissive about mixing art and multimedia, her experiences at the CAC were eye-opening. It was there she was able to get the first-hand perspective of digital artists, and she found that they had some legitimately interesting ideas about creating in digital spaces. She is finding some major plusses to working with digital tools. Not spending three weeks layering oil paints and waiting for them to dry is nice! She can knock out a portrait in a couple hours now. And who doesn&#8217;t love &#8220;Undo&#8221;?
</p>

<p>
We just like and having Tammy around. Just look at the portraits she did of <a href="http://">@cdmwebs</a>&#8217;s boys. Cute as a button!

<p>We&#8217;re big fans of <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a> here at Gaslight. We like having <a href="http://blog.gaslight.co/2012/08/23/cocoapods-and-you-a-primer-for-the-uninformed.html">dependencies managed for us</a>, <a href="http://blog.gaslight.co/2012/08/23/cocoapods-and-you-a-primer-for-the-uninformed.html">source fetched</a> and <a href="http://blog.gaslight.co/2012/08/23/cocoapods-and-you-a-primer-for-the-uninformed.html">compiler and linker flags set automatically</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been using a proprietary library called <a href="http://sensiblecocoa.com/overview/">SensibleTableView</a> for building out TableViews quickly in our project. Since it&#8217;s proprietary, we can&#8217;t just give Cocoapods a podspec and fetch it automatically, but I didn&#8217;t want our project cluttered with dependencies. So, here&#8217;s how we made it work.</p>

<h2>Enter Local Podspecs</h2>

<p>CocoaPods allows the use of <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/178">local podspecs</a>. That means you can use a local path to a directory on your computer and write a Podspec in that directory and use CocoaPods just like you&#8217;d expect. Here&#8217;s what our Podfile looks like:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">platform :ios, '5.1'
inhibit_all_warnings!

pod 'SensibleTableView', :local =&gt; "vendor/frameworks/STV 3.1.3 Pro/Source Code/SensibleTableView/"
pod 'STV+CoreData', :local =&gt; "vendor/frameworks/STV 3.1.3 Pro/Source Code/STV+CoreData/"
</code></pre>

<p>Of note, <code>inhibit_all_warnings!</code> is a pretty handy little setting to hide all the noise in libraries you&#8217;re using from CocoaPods. It&#8217;s nice to remove a bit of noise you don&#8217;t need to focus on at the moment.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the Podspec for SensibleTableView:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name = 'SensibleTableView'
  s.version = '3.1.3'
  s.platform = :ios
  s.ios.deployment_target = '5.0'
  s.prefix_header_file = 'SensibleTableView/SensibleTableView-Prefix.pch'
  s.source_files = 'SensibleTableView/STV-Core/*.{h,m}'
  s.requires_arc = true
end
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s path is <code>vendor/frameworks/STV 3.1.3 Pro/Source Code/SensibleTableView/SensibleTableView.podspec</code>, if you&#8217;re wondering.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. Cocoapods is great and you should be using it, too.</p>

<h1>A Case for CoffeeScript</h1>

<p></p>

<p>I’ve been writing JavaScript applications for the past few years. I’ve spent a lot of time learning JavaScript, and I’ve established a pretty solid development work-flow. We use <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> here at Gaslight, so when I came on-board, I was not at all excited to switch. I’ve spent the past few months in CoffeeScript, I can honestly say that I was wrong. I think CoffeeScript is great and here’s why:</p>



<h3>Beauty</h3>

<p></p>

<p>I hate to admit it, but JavaScript is just plain ugly. It’s not so much the brackets, parens and semicolons that bother me. It’s that I have to type things like <code>function(){}</code> and <code>var that = this</code> all over the place. I didn’t notice it so much when I was writing JavaScript, but now when I switch back, it bugs the crap out of me. CoffeeScript is expressive. It&#8217;s loops, comprehensions, splats and string interpolation are much cleaner than the javascript counterparts. Using CoffeeScript, I can easily write code that reads well. I found that very difficult to do in JavaScript.</p>



<h3>Whitespace</h3>

<p></p>

<p>This had been one of my biggest perceived qualms with the CoffeeScript syntax. I’ve never liked significant whitespace in languages. In reality, I didn’t find it to be a problem. I’m really OCD, so I can’t stand reading code that isn’t properly indented. With JavaScript, I spent a lot of time making sure that my code was well-styled. CoffeeScript takes some of that away by ensuring that my indentation is correct. I’ve also found that CoffeeScript is pretty liberal with its syntax. Things like object literals, loops and conditionals can be put on one line or multiple.</p>



<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p></p>

<p>I spend a lot of time in the Chrome debugger, so the thought of stepping through code that I didn’t write was a real concern. That ended up not really bothering me. The best thing about CoffeeScript is that it’s nearly one-to-one with JavaScript. I can step through the debugger and know exactly where everything came from, and it’s rare that I get confused about the translation. With source maps soon to be released, this won’t be a problem at all.</p>



<h3>Linting</h3>

<p></p>

<p>When I was writing JavaScript, I always ran my code through a linter. With CoffeeScript, I don’t need to. I know that the compiled JS will always be valid. It protects me from those JS got-cha’s like forgetting to put <code>var</code> or missing a trailing comma on a object literal.</p>



<h2>The Downside</h2>

<p></p>

<p>CoffeeScript is great, but it’s not all unicorns and rainbows. The biggest headache is setting up the compile step. A lot of Ruby people start a Javascript project with Rails just to get this for free with the asset pipeline. Most people still have to set up the workflow themselves. <a href="https://github.com/rockwood/grunt-coffeepot">Grunt Coffeepot</a> is a Grunt project I’ve been working on to serve compiled CoffeeScript on-demand.</p>



<p>It’s also a pain when you need to convert someone else’s JavaScript into CoffeeScript. I’m hoping that things like this will get easier as the tooling matures. The CoffeeScript language is still young, and there’s a lot that more that can be done to make the workflow easier.</p>



<h3>Yay, now I don’t have to learn JavaScript!</h3>

<p></p>

<p>NO! CoffeeScript is an enhancement, not an alternative. It helps to have have an understanding of JavaScript before switching to CoffeeScript. For example, if you’re going to use CoffeeScript classes, you should take the time to really understand Javascript’s prototypal inheritance. Sometimes it makes more sense not to use classes, and it’s good to have the basic understanding of native JavaScript so that you have options. Things like the <code>extends</code> operator, and CoffeeScripts’s list comprehensions are doing some really crazy stuff behind the scenes that you should be aware of. Coffeescript won’t write good code for you. That’s your job.</p>



<h2>Try it!</h2>

<p></p>

<p>I was once a CoffeeScript hater, but these past few months have changed that. JavaScript pre-compilers are getting more and more popular, and CoffeeScript is just one the many out there. As the tooling for these pre-compilers matures, more developers will adopt them. Even if you cringe at the idea of pre-compiled JavaScript, it’s worth giving it a try.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably not surprising that many of us Gaslighters would consider ourselves gamers. In fact, as I write this, I&#8217;m over-hearing <a href="https://twitter.com/dougalcorn">@dougalcorn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/st23am">@st23am</a> standing at the coffee machine, sharing their weekend &#8220;Eve Online&#8221; exploits. As such, it was our great pleasure to provide a home for a couple of aspiring young game developers this Summer. If <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">&#8220;Indie Game: The Movie&#8221;</a> and this brave new world of the internet has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that game development and publishing are no longer confined to the realm of big budget studios. The tools and channels are available to those with the urge to create.</p>

<p>One of our guests, Vincent Wilson, will be presenting at this week&#8217;s <a href="http://cincijs.com">CinciJs</a> group here at Gaslight. He was kind enough to write up some of his experiences, cutting his teeth on a popular JavaScript game development framework.</p>

<hr><p>Hello, my name is Vincent Wilson and I am a sixteen year old who is highly interested in software development. I have loved to program ever since I discovered the art around the age of 11. I have been acquiring skill in Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby, HTML and CSS since that time.</p>

<p>This summer I worked with Josh Alcorn on creating &#8220;The Inferno&#8221;, a platformer game in the theme of Dante’s Inferno. Over a period of around two weeks, Josh and I met up five times at Gaslight to develop the game (or at least part of it). The work was done using <a href="http://impactjs.com/">Impact.js</a>, a Javascript/HTML5 Canvas Game Engine.</p>

<p>To begin the project, we took examples out of Jesse Freeman’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-HTML5-Development-Jesse-Freeman/dp/1449315178">Introducing HTML5 Game Development</a>.  Using the ideas contained within the book, we constructed a simple class that managed the movement of the player, including running and jumping as well as a little bug testing feature / Easter egg, flying (if you are curious, trying pressing F, L, and Y all at the same time while the canvas is in focus).  I completed most of this while Josh began work on the graphics for the levels we planned to create.</p>

<p>Over lunch on the first day we decided that we wished to create, in episodes, the nine layers of Dante’s Inferno. We began on the first ring, limbo.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdfohpPLf61r9fv8b.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

<p>Impact.js contains a tile based level editor that makes creating levels as simple as creating the assets, importing the assets into the level editor (entitled Weltmeister), and then dragging to paint tiles. You can paint collision tiles to define the collision, as well as placing entities that have independent .js files into the level.</p>

<p>Impact.js has a fairly robust physics and collision system built into the game. Physics are handled simply, and moving is accomplished, at least within our game, by simply setting an acceleration for the player in the player class&#8217;s update function while a key is held down, and then setting the velocity to zero when no keys are held down.</p>

<p>By overriding the engine&#8217;s &#8220;check&#8221; class it is possible to modify what happens when two entities collide. Each entity has a built in check class (which manages collision) and a kill class (which is called either manually or when an entity has taken a set amount of &#8220;damage&#8221;). In the example of the spikes which can be found throughout the planes of limbo, there is a trigger entity, which when touched by the player, calls a hurt entity, which then deals a configurable amount of damage to the entity that collided with the trigger. By overriding the player&#8217;s kill class, I was able to spawn a few bloody chunk entities (subclassed from a particle entity) which are designed to fade away after a set amount of time.</p>

<p>We decided to make a platformer because of my previous experiences with similar games, but Impact.js is a very capable engine.  The applications that can be created with it are nearly limited only by your imagination. Among the games developed with Impact, I have seen dungeon crawlers, role playing games, shoot em ups, pong look-alikes, and Tetris clones.</p>

<p>Along the way I learned about several important topics, the most prominent being:</p>

<ul><li><p>Scope creep: Josh and I began with a simple idea; create a fun and functional level in Impact.js. As work on the project continued, the scope began to creep up on us. Fairly soon we had plans for features such as wall climbing and bouncy blocks and several other features which we didn’t have the time to implement. This led to a situation where we spread out our energy over an area that was too large, allowing us to accomplish little compared to focusing our energy on areas that we could complete.</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of version control in a multi-person project. I have used version control in the past, but it was only after this project that I began to realize the real advantages of using it. We began by using Dropbox to manage inter-computer file exchange but quickly stopped using that in exchange for git because of Dropbox’s inability to efficiently handle file conflicts. Using git along with Github we had no issues managing the files for the project with ease.</p></li>
</ul><p>My time at Gaslight was time well spent. I would be speaking for both Josh and myself if I stated that I readily enjoyed my time, and I very much wish to continue to work in the software development field. You can view what we completed at:

<p class="p1">GiveCamp this year was a great opportunity and I had an awesome time. Taking a weekend out and focusing on giving back to charities that are making a difference in peoples lives and communities felt really good. Also I got to hang out with some great people.</p>



<p class="p1">Our charity CUFA (Communities United for Action) came to us in need of a way for people to report on properties that have become problems in their community.</p>



<p class="p1">The app (<a href="http://cufacincy.heroku.com/"><span class="s1"><a href="http://cufacincy.heroku.com"><a href="http://cufacincy.heroku.com">http://cufacincy.heroku.com</a></a></span></a>) that we built to help out with this problem was in concept pretty simple. It allowed a person to report a house by address for various problems such as high grass, overgrown bushes, and broken windows to CUFA who then can report the property to the correct authorities for a municipality. It also allowed CUFA to provide the user with some helpful contact info for local representatives for that municipality who could assist them.</p>



<p class="p1">Over the weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) we set out to build this application and along the way I feel like it reaffirmed a lot of what I have learned about writing software.</p>



<p class="p1">The first thing it reaffirmed was the value of a good team. This year our team largely consisted of people from here at Gaslight. Don’t get me wrong I love working with new people and getting a chance to pair with other developers. However, with the short time frame it was really nice to have a team behind me that I was used to working with and I knew how to collaborate with. Also having the support of two of our very talented designers Ryan Arthur and Kristin Lasita was a huge boon. One of the skills that was in high demand the entire weekend was that of good designers. I would love to see more designers get involved next year!</p>

<p>

<p class="p1">Second something that is true for any software project; Having direct timely access and feedback to and from your client / product owner is vital! With just the weekend to deliver it was a huge win for the project that our charity was available most of the day for all three days. At times I felt bad because we spent a lot of our time with our heads down in our laptops or lost in the back and forth discussion that is involved in pairing but, whenever we ran into issues or questions about a feature Kevin or Mary from CUFA was there to help us. Their help was invaluable and we could not have delivered without them. Huge thanks goes out to Kevin and Mary for sticking it out with us.</p>



<p class="p1">Another thing that struck me was the value of up front planning and the conversations that were had prior to GiveCamp. Thanks goes out to CUFA, Bill Barnett, and Chris Moore from Gaslight. Pairing down, prioritizing and taking the time to write stories ahead of time was essential. Knowing and having confidence as well as understanding the value of what you are working on is always critical to the success of a project. <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> stories and <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> really shined here and allowed us to move and execute quickly.</p>



<p class="p1">The fourth thing that was reaffirmed to me was not matter how well you plan or how much you have thought a problem out; software is hard and there is always something you did not plan for. In our case we relied on certain geocoding data from Google that was not as consistent as we had hoped. Despite problems and at times feeling like we may have bit off more than we could chew we were able to deliver on the core of what CUFA had asked us for. That felt really good.</p>

<p>I was proud of our team and all of the other teams at GiveCamp. There were tons of success stories like ours over the weekend and a lot of awesome charities benefited. I met so many passionate, smart and caring people this year and the energy in the rooms over the weekend was high and infectious even into the late evenings. The entire support team of GiveCamp did an excellent job keeping team leaders on and focused with regular standups about every hour and made sure people got help whenever they needed it. There was around the clock snacks, meals and support and I cannot thank them enough for the wonderful job they did. I can’t wait to see what GiveCamp can accomplish next year!!</p>
