  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend I participated the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/">2012 Rails Rumble</a>. The Rumble is  programming competition where teams of up to 4 people have 48 hours to build a web application with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>My teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/joshowens">@joshowens</a> had actually won the contest in 2007 with his recipe building application &#8220;Tasty Planner&#8221;. In the years since, I got the impression that the field had grown quite a bit. When I heard that there were 500 registrations this year, I was wondering what I was getting myself into.</p>

<p>After the fact though, my attitude is that this competition is totally winnable. If you know how to play the game, a decent idea and good planning beforehand can take you a long way.</p>

<h2>ShareBelt</h2>

<p>The idea for the application was hatched by Josh. It&#8217;s a tool for encouraging sharing on website or blog. It displays a single, prominent share option onto a web page, tailored to each visitor based on where they came from. That message and share button floats in a bar at the top or bottom of any page.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="http://sharebelt.com/">Sharebelt</a>&#8221;. If a user arrives at your ShareBelt-enabled blog from Twitter, they might see a message at the top of the page:  &#8220;Hi I see you came from Twitter, why not [Retweet] this?&#8221;, with a button allowing them to do so.</p>

<div style="margin: 30px 0 30px 0; text-align:center; width: 100%"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcfc4blx6P1r9fv8b.png"/></div>

<p>Our initial prototype would recognize visitors from, and allow sharing to Twitter and Facebook. Our backend administration application would capture statistics, and report on daily Sharebelt impressions, clicks, tweets, shares, and likes for our users.</p>

<h2>ShareBelt Implementation</h2>

<p>There was a pretty obvious separation in the technology required to make ShareBelt happen, so splitting the work between two developers was pretty cut and dry.</p>

<p>The ShareBelt itself is implemented on the client-side with Javascript. A ShareBelt account holder receives a snippet of html code to paste into their website, anywhere they want the ShareBelt to pop in. The snippet contains an id that represents the site of the account holder in the ShareBelt system, and a script tag that loads the main Javascript code from a location on the ShareBelt server.</p>

<p>The ShareBelt backend is the Rails piece. It provides routes for the data capturing, and an administration interface for ShareBelt clients. Data is captured when users take actions like tweeting or liking. The administration interface allows ShareBelt users to set up and see reporting and analytics on any number websites.</p>

<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

<p>As the main Javascript developer, my first challenge was wrestling with cross-domain Ajax requests. The problem occurs any time javascript code running on site attempts to call out to a location outside the current domain. Browsers will prohibit these kinds of Ajax requests, but the workaround is so common that it makes the restriction quite trivial.</p>

<p>Although browsers will restrict the Ajax call, they will happily load and run Javascript at a location set in the &#8220;src&#8221; attribute of a script tag. The strategy is then to, instead of calling out with Ajax, to call out with a script tag. When you append the script tag into a document, it gets fetched and executed.</p>

<pre><code data-language="coffeescript">injectScript: (d) -&gt;
    script = d.createElement("script")
    script.setAttribute("src", "http://endpoint.com")
    d.head.appendChild(script)
</code></pre>

<p>In order to do something with what that call returns, the endpoint needs to return JSONP. Executed JSONP calls a method on the client-side that has been defined by you, most likely in the same piece of Javascript that injected the script tag. For example, JSONP returned from the server might look something like:</p>

<pre><code data-language="javascript">executeResponse({"some": "JSON", "data": "here"})</code></pre>

<p>That piece of code is returned from your endpoint, and evaluated on the client-side where you have previously defined the executeResponse method. It&#8217;s a little tricky, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.devproconnections.com/article/aspnet2/ajax-cross-domain-142169">Dino Esposito</a>, and my partner <a href="http://twitter.com/joshowens">@joshowens</a> are all good resources on this subject.</p>

<p>That hurdle surpassed, I was able to build enough infrastructure to load some appropriate HTML and Javascript from the ShareBelt server based on where the visitor had come from, and capture an impression on the backend.</p>

<p>The bulk of that returned code is publicly-provided snippets for loading Facebook and Twitter sharing widgets. So, at this point in the project, I could render the belt and widgets, and people could do the sharing. But how was I going to capture and record the actions that users took with these third-party tools?</p>

<p>Luckily, this didn&#8217;t turn out to be as much of a challenge as I expected. I found that both Twitter and Facebook platforms provided a pretty full featured system for triggering callbacks on events. Twitter&#8217;s is called <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents">Web Intents</a> and allowed me to trigger code on a click of the Tweet button, and the Tweet itself. Facebook&#8217;s Like and Share callbacks I configured via the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/">FB.Event.subscribe()</a> API. Read Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript">Javascript SDK</a> page to get started with that.</p>

<p>What kind of code did I want to execute with these callbacks? More cross domain Javascript requests, of course! Once you recognize the script injection pattern, you see it everywhere. In fact, both of the publicly-available Twitter and Facebook snippets are themselves using script injection to fetch and render their sharing widgets ( and do who knows what else ).</p>

<h2>48 Hours</h2>

<p>Time did not turn out to be as big of a challenge as I expected with respect to coding. I don&#8217;t think my code is completely horrible, but I did take some shortcuts. The scope of the minimum viable product we laid out were manageable.</p>

<p>I did feel some urgency and so I didn&#8217;t test drive. It felt ok, until it didn&#8217;t. At some point the discomfort of cowboy coding overtakes the speed benefit you get from it. A little more than halfway through the competition, about 10&#160;o&#8217;clock on Saturday night, I spent my last  couple of hours putting in <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and refactoring the bulk of my Javascript code into a classes that I could test. I learned things. It became apparent from this experience why it&#8217;s bad to access the document object directly from within a class. I couldn&#8217;t test the code in the absence of a document object. Mocking and passing the document into the class broke dependency, and allowed me to take control. It reminded me of what I like so much about coding Javascript. Objects are so easily mockable and re-shapable.</p>

<div style="margin: 30px 0 30px 0; text-align:center; width: 100%"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcfc9zDlms1r9fv8b.png"/></div>

<p>Time was a factor in design and marketing. <a href="http://twitter.com/nerdyllama">@nerdyllama</a>, our designer was not able to get much direction from us, and was not able to iterate as quickly as we could. We failed to effectively plan for setting up demonstrations of the product in action, and we even failed to put Sharebelt on the Sharebelt landing page! Our ranking definitely suffered as a result of poor planning in the presentation of our application.</p>

<h2>New-to-Me Tools</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m used to Heroku, but the Rumble was hosted on Linode, and we did deploys with capistrano. We were using <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> to keep in constant contact, and one of the first things Josh did was to set up <a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/capistrano-campfire">capistro-campfire</a>. Whenever a team-member did a deploy, campfire posted a link to the git commit so we could see the new code and diffs. With large teams or large projects, this might be overkill. But in a small team working on small overlapping pieces of code on a tight schedule it was really, really handy.</p>

<p>The other cool tool was the <a href="http://nvd3.com/">NVD3</a> charting library. The interface reminded me a lot of <a href="http://www.highcharts.com">Highcharts</a>, I can&#8217;t say I prefer one to the other. The series plotting made a little more sense to me out of the box, and NVD3 might have a slight edge on the presentation as well. I&#8217;ve been impressed by both, but if you&#8217;ve had any issues with Highcharts give NVD3 a try.</p>

<h2>Rumble Regrets</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, a lack of a plan for presenting the product is my biggest regret. We have a working application that touches on some pretty interesting and relevant technologies, but we left it up to the judges to figure out how to use it. The irony is that most of this most essential planning work could have been done legally in the weeks leading up to the competition. Live and learn!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When the clock struck 8PM on Sunday night, I took a deep breath. The feeling was surreal. The whole weekend had happened, I had learned a ton of new stuff, and I had a pretty tangible product sitting in front of me. I had a strong feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment. I would definitely do this again.</p>

<p>Rumble applications have a history of becoming real products. As for <a href="http://sharebelt.com/">Sharebelt</a>, we plan to get it in front of people and continue development. Is it going to make a million-dollars? I have no clue. But thanks to the motivation and focus provided by the competition, it&#8217;s more than an idea, which is where 99% of products begin and end. Rumble on!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last couple of years, we at Gaslight have built a lot of web
  applications that consist of a backbone.js front end talking to a rails
  backend.</p>

<p>Backbone.js is light-weight and relatively un-opinionated, and this is a
  large reason it&#8217;s been so successful.  But this also means that there
  is still a fair bit of manual work to do on the backbone.js side.
  Particularly if you&#8217;re building a form-heavy app and are used to
  rails, some of this work can feel quite tedious. In no particular order, some
  of the non-trivial bits that are left to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building form markup</li>
  <li>moving data back and forth from your views to your models</li>
  <li>dealing with errors from the backend and rendering appropriate error messages</li>
  <li>validation (client-side or server-side)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic" title="Backtastic">Backtastic</a>
  is a framework I started to try and extract some of the code I found myself
  needing on several projects and automate away as much as I could of this
  effort.  The easiest way to explain what it&#8217;s about is by example.
  Let&#8217;s say you have a person view within your backbone.js app that
  persists to a Person model in rails:</p>

<p><img alt="Edit Person" height="400" src="https://img.skitch.com/20121009-rsypmaxjifq69winnrxbiyw8b9.png" width="500"/></p>

<p>With Backtastic, here&#8217;s what the backbone view code would look like:</p>

<pre><code data-language="coffeescript">class Example.Views.EditPersonView extends Backtastic.Views.FormView
  template: JST["edit_person_view_template"]
  
  constructor: (options)->
    super
    @occupations = options.occupations
      
  events:
    "submit form": "save"
    
  render: ->
    super
    @$el.addClass "modal"
    
  edit: (person)->
    @model = person
    @render()
    @$el.modal "show"
  
  close: ->
    @$el.modal "hide"</code></pre>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice is that there&#8217;s nothing in this
  code to deal with the form, either rendering it or populating it&#8217;s
  values onto the model.  That&#8217;s because backtastic takes care of this
  for us: we get this functionality because our view extends from
  Backtastic.FormView.  Notice also the form submit event is bound to save.
  This method is inherited from Backtastic.View, and as you might guess, calls
  save on the model after it has been populated with it&#8217;s values from the
  form.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the view template:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">.modal-header
  %a{class: "close", href: "#people/list"} x
  %h3 New Person
%form.person-form
  .modal-body
    %fieldset
      = @textField(field: "first_name", label: "First Name")
      = @textField(field: "last_name", label: "Last Name")
      = @checkBoxField(field: "evil", label: "Evil")
      = @dateField(field: "birth_date", label: "Birth Date", format: "yyyy-mm-dd")
      = @selectField(field: "occupation_id", label: "Occupation", collection: @occupations)
  .modal-footer
    %input{type: "submit", value: "Save", class: "btn btn-primary"}</code></pre>
    
<p>Here we see the view helper methods that build form elements.  Again, we get
  these methods from Backtastic.FormView. They do more than just render form
  element markup, though.  What they&#8217;re actually doing is creating
  subviews, or smaller views that render within our larger form view.  Each
  view is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rendering form element markup</li>
  <li>listening to form element events and updating the model</li>
  <li>listening for validation errors from the model and displaying them</li>
</ul>

<p>There are form element subviews and corresponding helper methods for text
  fields, checkboxes, select boxes, and date pickers. Expect more to come along
  soon, and pull requests are of course welcome. </p>

<p>The observant reader might also notice that we&#8217;re using twitter
  bootstrap. This gives us nice layout for our forms, and gives us some help
  with displaying validation errors as well.</p>

<h2>Validation in Backtastic</h2>

<p>Backbone, out of the box, doesn&#8217;t really give us much help in the way
  of validation. We have a validate method on Backbone.Model, and are left to
  implement it ourself. Returning anything non-null from this method indicates
  failure, but it&#8217;s up to us what exactly it returns and what it
  means.</p>

<p>Backtastic gives us a bit more help, particularly if you are using rails at
  the back end. First, if you respond with validation errors from rails as
  json, Backtastic will decode this json and send it to any response handlers
  that are listening to &#8220;error&#8221; events on your Backbone models.
  And conveniently, all the form field subviews register themselves as
  listeners to their model&#8217;s error event and will display errors for
  their own field. We leverage twitter bootstrap&#8217;s css to provide nice
  styling for error messages.</p>

<p>But what about doing validation on the client side? It&#8217;s worth
  pointing out that client side validation by itself is never good enough.
  Because you always need validation on the servier side, Backtastic gives you
  a way to easily bring the validations from your rails models to your backbone
  models.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: Backtastic ships with a rake task,
  backtastic:validations:build, which will reflect on all ActiveRecord models
  and generate a file representing their validations in a format backtastic can
  understand.  Here&#8217;s what this looks like in the example app:</p>

<pre><code data-language="coffeescript">Backtastic.Rails =
  validations: {}

Backtastic.Rails.validations.Occupation = {}

Backtastic.Rails.validations.Person = {"first_name":{"presence":{}},"last_name":{"format":{"with":"/^J.*/"}}}
</code></pre>

<p>Somewhere in the setup of your client side app, you can then pass this
  validation data to backtastic by calling Backtastic.applyValidations.
  Here&#8217;s what this looks like:</p>

<pre><code data-language="coffeescript">#= require_self
#= require_tree ./templates
#= require_tree ./models
#= require_tree ./views
#= require_tree ./routers
#= require rails_validations

window.Example =
  Models: {}
  Collections: {}
  Routers: {}
  Views: {}

$ ->
  new Example.Routers.PeopleRouter()
  Backbone.history.start()
  Backtastic.applyValidations(Example.Models, Backtastic.Rails.validations)</code></pre>

<p>The first arg is the namespace in which to find backbone model classes and
  the second arg is the validation data. The net effect is that we now have
  validations executing on the client side when I make changes to a field.
  Right now, this works for a subset of validations: presence and format so
  far. Expect this list to grow as Backtastic matures.</p>

<h2>See for yourself</h2>

<p>The best way to dig in to <a href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic"
    title="Backtastic">Backtastic</a> further is to poke around the example
  app. All the code in this post come straight from this app, which you can get
  to by cloning backtastic on the githubs and running the rails app in the
  example directory.</p>

<h2>Backtastic needs you!</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s still early times for <a
    href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic"
    title="Backtastic">Backtastic</a>, and it&#8217;s a great time to jump in.
  We&#8217;d love to see people contribute more types of form field views and
  additional validations, just to throw out a couple ideas. These both should
  be pretty easy to jump in with by following the &#8220;monkey see, monkey
  do&#8221; approach from the form fields and validations that already
  there.</p>

<p>Our reality is that we have been more successful with some clients and projects than others. At our recent Gaslight retreat we spent a lot of time trying to decide the formula that led to success and the things that did not. One of our biggest goals is to have happy Gaslighters and happy clients. Project success is a big factor in our overall happiness.
We want to end projects proud of our results and with clients happy with what we&#8217;ve done.</p>

<h2>The most important thing</h2>

<p>On the surface, it&#8217;s easy to come up with a laundry list of things we think will make a project be awesome. We like project work where we can control the whole process from beginning to end. But we&#8217;ve also been successful inheriting large (legacy) code bases. We like to bring the whole project in house and work together as a team. But we&#8217;ve also been successful doing straight up staff augmentation. We like to engage directly with the client to learn first hand what the problem is and how solving it affects them. But we&#8217;ve also done successful projects where the end user was represented by a third-party proxy.</p>

<p>The more we talked about our successes and &#8220;less than successes&#8221; the more apparent what the true common denominator is. In almost every case, it comes down to the amount of time the client is willing to spend with us.</p>

<h2>Give the Dog a Bone</h2>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbqiipIHBM1r9fv8b.jpg" class="left-image" style="width: 35%; height: 35%"/>Client engagement pertains to how involved the owner is in the day-to-day activities of the project. The more we talk to clients, the more enthusiastic and satisfied we are in our work.</p>

<p>The opposite is also true. For developers, lack of attention from a client can quickly take a project to the dark side. Not speaking regularly can lead to doubt and paranoia. Inability to ship code or get stories accepted can lead to discouragement and apathy. It&#8217;s in everybody&#8217;s best interest to talk often, and always be moving the project forward.</p>

<p>Clients, view your development team as an adorable little puppy. Give them plenty of love and attention and guidance. Care and ownership of a development team is not to be taken lightly:</p>

<ul><li>We need to you to meet with us daily to see what we&#8217;ve done and tell us what a good job we&#8217;re doing</li>
<li>We need you to write the individual stories and tell us what it means to be &#8220;done&#8221; with the story</li>
<li>We need you to verify the stuff we&#8217;ve done meets your expectations, even the ones you didn&#8217;t tell us about</li>
<li>We need you to regularly review overall objectives and set priorities</li>
</ul><p>We need you to do these things all the time. Just like puppy training, consistency is the key.</p>

<h2>Self Evaluation</h2>

<p>Before you begin you next project, as yourself these questions:</p>

<ul><li>How many hours can you spend talking to us each week?</li>
<li>How quickly can you respond to and accept our work?</li>
<li>Can you / Are you willing to write stories for features?</li>
<li>What was your previous team like?</li>
</ul><h2>Group Hug!</h2>

<p>So there it is, touchy-feely engagement is the key. Success or failure is rarely a matter technology or domain. Overshadowing all other considerations, the correlation between positive client engagement and project health is clear and visible. Now go and take your development team for a walk around the block!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we&#8217;re launching a new identify for <a href="http://gaslight.co">Gaslight</a>. We&#8217;re dropping &#8216;Software&#8217; from our name, and we&#8217;ve created a new mark, thanks to our design team. We&#8217;ll continue to roll out these changes as our new website takes form. We&#8217;re excited for this change and the things that have happened over the last year at Gaslight that have led us here.</p>

<h2>Good design is essential</h2>

<p>Since its beginning, Gaslight has primarily been known as the top Ruby on Rails shop in Cincinnati. Our team originally consisted almost exclusively of developers, and this software-heavy focus was evident in the type of projects we worked on, and the work we produced. We often relied on our clients to provide design for our web applications, or we just added new features with the existing look and feel. However, it increasingly became apparent that we needed to add competent designers to our team. This was most obvious to us as we planned for <a href="http://www.qcmerge.com">QCMerge</a> this past spring. We talked about a theme for the conference, but as soon as we had a book of branding concepts, our ideas really came to life. The same is true for the work we do internally, and the work we do for our clients. Good design is essential, and it&#8217;s hard to bolt on at the end of a project. We want to treat design as a primary concern on every project that we work on, and our team is now able to do this.</p>

<h2>Refining the Process</h2>

<p>Over time we&#8217;ve learned the level of communication with our client is the best indicator for project success. We&#8217;ve designated a guide to help facilitate the engagement between the client and the rest of the team. Joe Cope, a whitewater rafting guide, <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/04/22/so-you-want-my-job-whitewater-rafting-guide/">says</a> about his job, &#8220;I just try to give people the most aggressive, intense ride they can handle, while keeping them safe, of course.&#8221; We want our clients to have the same experience with projects they bring to us.</p>

<p>Our designers, developers and (most importantly) clients are all on the same team. We value the happiness of our whole team. Like whitewater rafting, our Project Guide is deeply vested in the success of the overall trip but is mainly there to make sure everyone has a good time.</p>

<h2>More than just Rails</h2>

<p>Lastly, the projects we&#8217;ve been working on often use tools other than Ruby on Rails. Currently, we&#8217;re building solutions with <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>, embedded systems with Ruby, and mobile applications for iOS devices. We still love Rails, but we&#8217;re mostly interested in solving the needs of our clients the best way we know how, and having more tools at our disposal allows us to build the right thing.</p>

<h2>Let&#8217;s Build Great Things</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to share more about what we&#8217;ve learned during our rebranding process. We&#8217;ll be posting more about the creative process of developing our new logo. Expect to also see posts about the workflow decisions we&#8217;re making on our projects, and lastly, how we integrate design into our project workflow.</p>

<p>Better yet, bring us your projects and we can level up together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last six months we&#8217;ve been building an application for a client in the agricultural industry. There was a need to use portions of the application on an iPad literally out in the field. The app also needed to be location-aware, allow offline access, and to be able to quickly render geographical data.</p>

<p>These factors made the decision to write an iOS app targeted to the iPad pretty simple. But in an iOS application where the user is collecting a lot of data, two challenges became apparent quickly.</p>

<ul><li>We needed an easy way to build forms around complicated object structures. </li>
<li>We needed a way to easily talk to the RESTful JSON services we exposed in our Rails app.</li>
</ul><p>We utilized two third party iOS frameworks to help meet these two challenges, and with mixed results. What follows is a review of those two frameworks, Sensible Table View and RestKit.</p>

<h2>Sensible Table View</h2>

<p>Most user activity in the app consists of recording field observations in the context of a larger report. Each report can have several observations, and each observation can have many different subcomponents. Essentially, we needed a way to support forms several layers deep, with lots of different data type controls. Thankfully, UINavigationController was a natural fit for the report workflow itself, as users would often be navigating into and out of detail views. However, as many have experienced, UIKit really lacks a decent form builder. Specifically, UITableViewController does not naturally orient around an object, or collection of objects. While there are a few form-building frameworks, none appeared nearly as complete as <a href="http://www.sensiblecocoa.com">SensibleTableView</a>, a paid framework.</p>

<p>STV is able to build a table view representation of an object, including subviews for that object&#8217;s relationships. By default, it will introspect your attribute types and display them with the corresponding UITableViwCell data type. This alone is extremely useful. STV also integrates with Core Data, provides many default UITableViewCell styles, and even allows for out of the box editing for object and attribute collections. The licensed product includes the source code, which is a good thing. STV does a lot of work for you, and at times I found myself not understanding what has happening or wondering why something wasn&#8217;t working the way I expected it to. To be honest, I spent a lot of time debugging source code.</p>

<p>The complexity of the framework required non-trivial rampup time, and it took a day or two of development time to get a handle on how to use STV in our application. STV does provide for decent code reuse, as class definitions used to create a table view are easily used in multiple screens. This was helpful in our application. Still, decisions need to be made about how many levels of views you&#8217;d like STV to create, and at times not fully owning the code for the view three levels deep from your object can be painful. Expect to set lots of tags on objects and implement delegate methods to customize as needed. Overall, I think we saved development effort by using SensibleTableView, but I also think we could&#8217;ve done almost as well by just using a formbuilder such as <a href="https://github.com/ittybittydude/IBAForms">IBAForms</a> or <a href="https://github.com/escoz/quickdialog">QuickDialog</a>, and then creating explicit detail view controllers as opposed to letting STV generate these views. At the end of the day, STV seems to almost do too much. This may save some time in the short term, but it&#8217;s not a lightweight framework and it will touch many parts of your application. Thankfully, you are not forced to use every feature of STV, and can use only the parts you find most useful, such as UITableViewCell styles.</p>

<h2>RestKit</h2>

<p>Consuming JSON in Objective-C can be accomplished in a few different ways. Starting in iOS 5.0, Apple provides NSJSONSerialization, which can be used to parse HTTP requests. For simple scenarios, that works fine. However, in a data structure with several layers of nested associations, JSON mapping code quickly becomes tedious. A framework such as AFNetworking eliminates some of the HTTP boilerplate in this approach, but still doesn&#8217;t solve difficult object mapping problems. We decided to instead use RestKit.</p>

<p>RestKit provides a relatively simple way to talk to RESTful services, mapping response payloads to Objective-C objects without a lot of boilerplate, and serializing objects back to JSON. To map objects with RestKit, class mapping definitions are typically added to the application-wide RestKit object manager. In addition to attributes, RestKit lets you define relationships between your models, and complicated JSON structures can easily be converted to Objective-C objects, and vice versa. This is really useful and powerful. RestKit provides a simple router that allows you to associate HTTP verbs and an Objective-C object mapping with a particular URL, so talking to your RESTful services is quite simple. RestKit also handles a lot of HTTP concerns such as caching, handling status codes, and dealing with HTTP headers. It, too, is not a lightweight framework but the problems it solves seem to be worth the impact it has in your application.</p>
