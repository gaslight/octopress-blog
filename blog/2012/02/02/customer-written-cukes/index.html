<div class="entry-content"><h3>&#8230;and why they&#8217;re awesome. Or not.</h3>

<p>On one of our more recent projects, we were given an entire suite of customer
written <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> features. We&#8217;ve toyed with Cucumber in the past, but this
was the first time we&#8217;ve actually implemented Cukes on a customer project. I
thought I&#8217;d take a few minutes and explain some of the completely awesome side
effects as well as the downsides.</p>

<h4>First: The awesome.</h4>

<p>The cukes were very well written. The last time I experimented with Cucumber,
web steps were still in vogue and I was ready to start where I had left off.
Fortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/superchris" title="@superchris">Chris Nelson</a> was there to keep me from going down that path.
He explained that the cukes were supposed to be written at a much higher level
and that the implementation of the steps were better suited to handling the
interactions with the specific inputs. It&#8217;s a good thing he did, too, or else I
would have made a mess of steps that weren&#8217;t going to be solid or reusable.</p>

<p>Second, the cukes contained some business logic in <a href="http://cukes.info/cucumber/api/ruby/latest/Cucumber/Ast/Table.html">AST
tables</a>
that turned out to be really super awesome when the time to implement the logic
came around. The logic revolved around meeting some criteria then recommending
a possible solution or enhancement. <a href="https://twitter.com/superchris" title="@superchris">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/st23am" title="@st23am">James</a>
were pairing on the project at the time and James mentioned that the tables
looked a lot like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a>
in disguise. The dynamic duo spent some time looking at Ruby implementations of
tree logic then decided that the rules weren&#8217;t quite as complex as the existing
solutions and moved ahead writing their own.</p>

<p>That turned out to be a really, really big win for this project. <a href="https://twitter.com/superchris" title="@superchris">Chris</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/st23am" title="@st23am">James Smith</a> created a base class to handle the rule and
conditional attributes, then for each specific case, we create a subclass to
match the specific answers to the persistence layer.</p>

<p><strong>Sample feature, with table</strong></p>

<pre><code>Feature: Replace common areas lighting with high efficacy fixtures
  So that I know which energy efficiency improvements my property would benefit
  from, as a property owner/manager, I see a list of recommended measures for
  my property after completing the property questionnaire.

  Scenario Outline: Replace common areas lighting with high efficacy fixtures
    Given I have completed the property questionnaire
    And the predominant lighting type of permanently installed lighting fixtures in common areas is &lt;lighting_type&gt;
    And on average, the common area lighting fixtures were last replaced &lt;last_replaced&gt;
    And common area lighting fixture replacement &lt;planned_in_scope&gt; part of the planned retrofit scope

    When I view the recommended measures for the property
    Then the system shows that the "Replace common areas lighting with high efficacy fixtures" measure is &lt;result&gt;

  Examples:
    | planned_in_scope | lighting_type         | last_replaced | result          |
    | is               | LED                   |               | recommended     |
    | is               | Flourescent           |               | recommended     |
    | is               | Screw-in CFL          |               | recommended     |
    | is               | Screw-in incandescent |               | recommended     |
    | is               | Don't know            | &gt;= 10 yrs ago | recommended     |
    | is               | Don't know            | &lt; 10 yrs ago  | recommended     |
    | is not           | LED                   |               | not recommended |
    | is not           | Flourescent           |               | not recommended |
    | is not           | Screw-in CFL          |               | recommended     |
    | is not           | Screw-in incandescent |               | recommended     |
    | is not           | Don't know            | &gt;= 10 yrs ago | recommended     |
    | is not           | Don't know            | &lt; 10 yrs ago  | not recommended |
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The base class:</strong></p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">module RecommendedMeasure
  class Measure

    attr_reader :property

    def initialize(property)
      @property = property
    end

    def to_s
      "This is a sample. You should replace this."
    end

    private

    def build_rules(data)
      keys = data.shift
      keys.pop
      data.map do |datum|
        criteria = {}.with_indifferent_access
        result = datum.unshift
        keys.each_with_index {|key, index| criteria[key] = datum[index] }
        Rule.new(self, criteria, datum.last == "recommended")
      end
    end

    def rules_file
      self.class.name.underscore + ".rules"
    end

    def rules_text
      File.read(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "..", rules_file))
    end

    def rules_data
      rules_data = Cucumber::Ast::Table.parse(rules_text, "", 0).raw
    end

    def match?
      self.build_rules(rules_data).each do |rule|
        return rule.result if rule.applies?
      end
      false
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>A subclass:</strong></p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">module RecommendedMeasure
  class ReplaceToilets &lt; Measure
    def to_s
      "Replace toilets"
    end

    def section
      "efficiency"
    end

    def gal_flush
      property.efficiency_responses[:toilet_gpf]
    end

    def last_replaced
      installed_before?(:toilet_year, 1992) ? "&lt; 1992" : "&gt;= 1992"
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h4>The not-so-awesome.</h4>

<p>One of the negatives we&#8217;ve encountered is the cone of focus can sometimes
become too narrow. As a developer, heads down working on the cukes, some of the
details of the implementation can be missed. For example, a few of the features
were passing for me, but that&#8217;s because I&#8217;d manipulated the state of the data
being tested in the step definition. I&#8217;d forgotten that when the client was
doing physical acceptance those actions wouldn&#8217;t be available to them. I had to
implement a scenario to allow the client to change the data so they could
produce the correct result. It&#8217;s a trivial step, but an important one to
remember nonetheless.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the test was that a program expired after a certain
date. We&#8217;d already constructed an administrative section of the application,
but because I made the changes programmatically in the cuke, my tests passed. I
delivered the feature for testing and got a message in Campfire a few minutes
later that made complete sense: I can&#8217;t test this one because I can&#8217;t change
the date!</p>

<h3>Cukes are a win!</h3>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m impressed with the process of developing features using customer
written cukes. Our client gave us an excellent starting point and it&#8217;s
something we&#8217;re trying to teach existing clients now as well. They aren&#8217;t for
everyone, but when the client has domain knowledge and is able to convey that
in clearly written steps, it&#8217;s a big, big win.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using cukes in my pet projects as well. The steps are easy enough
to write and if you&#8217;re already doing integration specs with something like
Capybara, it seems like a worthwhile step.</p>

<p>Another real benefit is the generated output.
<a href="https://www.relishapp.com/">Relish</a> is a site for open source projects tested
with Cucumber to host their docs. Some of Cucumber&#8217;s <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/tag-logic">own
documentation</a> is
generated with Cucumber! You can also find
<a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">Rspec</a> there as well.</p>
